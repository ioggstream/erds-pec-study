<h2><span class="section-number">1.8. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Business and administrative relationships among companies, public administrations and private citizens are more and more implemented electronically. Trust is essential for their success and continued development of electronic services. It is therefore important that any entity using electronic services have suitable security controls and mechanisms in place to protect their transactions and to ensure trust and confidence with their partners.</p>
<p>Electronic signatures are commonly used worldwide to ensure authenticity and integrity of electronic documents, making it possible to transform traditional paper-based processes into electronic ones providing a comparable or even higher level of assurance. As communication is becoming predominantly internet-based, secure and provable exchange of documents is essential to the full digital transformation.</p>
<p>An electronic registered delivery service (ERDS hereinafter) provides secure and reliable delivery of electronic messages between parties, producing evidence of the delivery process for legal accountability. Evidence can be seen as a declaration by a trusted party that a specific event related to the delivery process (submission of a message, relay of a message, delivery of a message, refusal of a message, etc.) happened at a certain time. Evidence can be immediately delivered to the interested party (together with the message or separately) or can be kept in a repository for later access. It is common practice to implement evidence as digitally signed data. Registered electronic mail (REM hereinafter) is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, which builds on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging.</p>
<p>In a number of national, regional or sector-specific communities electronic registered delivery and registered electronic mail services are already in place, and even more are being developed. Without the definition of common standards there will be no consistency in the services provided, making it difficult for users to compare them. Under these circumstances, users might be prevented from easily changing to alternative providers, damaging free competition. Lack of standardization might also adversely affect interoperability between implementations which are based on different models.</p>
<p>The present document is one of a set of interrelated documents (framework of ERDS standards hereinafter) ETSI has produced to facilitate a consistent form of electronic registered delivery service inside and outside Europe, especially with regard to the form of evidence provided, in order to maximize interoperability even between domains governed by different policy rules. This set of documents includes the following deliverables:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 522 [i.16]: a multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Electronic Registered     Delivery Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 532 [i.17]: a multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Registered Electronic     Mail Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 521 [i.18]: providing Policy and Security Requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery     Service Providers.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 531 [i.19]: providing Policy and Security Requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service     Providers.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI TS 119 524 [i.20]: a multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance and     Interoperability of Electronic Registered Delivery Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI TS 119 534 [i.21]: a multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance and     Interoperability of Registered Electronic Mail Services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The documents covering ERDS contain the general concepts and requirements which apply to all kinds of electronic registered delivery services. Since REM is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, the documents covering REM service build on the corresponding documents covering ERDS by referencing the necessary provisions, and define the interpretation and specific requirements which apply only to registered electronic mail.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [i.4] (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or Regulation hereinafter) provides a legal framework to facilitate cross-border recognition between existing national legal systems related to electronic registered delivery services. That framework aims to open new market opportunities for European Union trust service providers to offer new panEuropean electronic registered delivery services. The Regulation defines the so-called qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS hereinafter), which is a special type of ERDS, where both the service and its provider need to meet a number of additional requirements that the regular ERDSs and their providers do not need to meet.</p>
<p>The framework of ERDS standards aims to cover the common and worldwide-recognized requirements to address electronic registered delivery in a secure and reliable way, independent of the applicable legislative framework. The documents contain generic requirements which can be applied in any geographic region. At the same time, the framework of ERDS standards aims to support demonstrating compliance to the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.4] (and related secondary legislation), both for non-qualified and qualified electronic registered delivery services. Specific clauses are included defining requirements for qualified services only, especially in the documents covering policy and security requirements. However, the legal effects of services implemented according to the framework of ERDS standards are outside the scope of the documents [i.16] to [i.21].</p>
<p>The present document is part 1 of ETSI EN 319 532 [i.17], which is a multi-part deliverable covering Registered Electronic Mail (REM) Services, as detailed in the Foreword. ETSI EN 319 522 contains the general concepts and requirements which apply to all kinds of ERDSs. Since registered electronic mail is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, the general provisions given in ETSI EN 319 522 apply to registered electronic mail as well. Hence, parts 1 and 2 of ETSI EN 319 532 are aligned with ETSI EN 319 522, and they reference the necessary provisions of the corresponding part.</p>

<p>Registered electronic mail service (REMS henceforth) is a specific type of electronic registered delivery service (ERDS henceforth), which builds on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging. The logical model of ERDS in general, as described in clause 4 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1], is applicable to REMS. See clause 4.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1] for an introduction to ERDS.</p>
<p>The next clauses describe the interpretation of the general ERDS model as applied in the specific case of REM. Clause 4.2 further specifies the black-box model described in clause 4.2 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1], focusing on the outer interfaces of the REMS. Clause 4.3 further specifies the 4-corner model described in clause 4.3 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1], explaining the interaction between the services of different REMSPs. Clause 4.4 further specifies the extended model described in clause 4.4 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1], providing the details about the interaction of the REMS with other REMSs in the case when more than 2 providers take part in the delivery process.</p>

<section id="functional-viewpoint">
<h4><span class="section-number">1.12.2.1. </span>4.2.1 Functional viewpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-viewpoint" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the simplest case, a REMS can be represented as a black box, conveying messages between a sender and a recipient and producing the appropriate ERDS evidence. Figure 1 below provides a simple representation.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Black-box REM model</p>
<p>The REMS is typically accessed by a «user agent» (i.e. an application directly interacting with a user), which can be an ordinary email client software or a tailored REM software, or by a generic application (i.e. automated system), which can be e.g. a document management system, accounting system, etc. In any case, the client software can use the standard email protocols (i.e. SMTP and POP/IMAP) and web protocols (i.e. HTTP) to access the REMS. Use of other protocols is also possible, but it is outside the scope of the present document.</p>
<p>As required for all ERDSs, the sender and recipients each have a unique identifier, by which they are referred in REM messages and ERDS evidence. For REMS the unique identifier of users is an email address, as required by clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 532-3 [i.2].</p>
<p>For the purpose of message submission certain metadata needs to be given by the sender to the REMS, e.g. recipient addresses, requested style of operation, delivery options. This metadata is conveyed in the header of the email message. Further specification of the content and format of the metadata can be found in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [i.1] and ETSI EN 319 532-3 [i.2].</p>
<p>The logical model presented in figure 1 refines the functionality of the REMS into separate components, which were historically also referred to as «roles». The general ERDS model applies to REM as well. For the description of the ERDS components see clause 4.2.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1].</p>
<p>The following components of REMS correspond to the general ERDS components as specified in table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1: Mapping of REMS components and ERDS components</p>
<p>Component of REMS Corresponding ERDS component REMS message delivery agent ERDS Message delivery system REMS evidence provider ERDS Evidence provider REMS evidence repository ERDS Evidence repository REMS user directory ERDS User directory</p>
<p>In addition to the general ERDS components, a REMS also provides a REMS message store component. A REMS message store is allocated to the senders and recipients, and is securely accessible by senders and recipients respectively to retrieve REM messages addressed to them.</p>
<p>The REMS shall include the following core roles: REMS message delivery agent, REMS message store, and REMS evidence provider. In addition, the REMS may include the REMS evidence repository and the REMS user directory.</p>

<h5><span class="section-number">1.12.2.2.1. </span>4.2.2.1 REM styles of operation<a class="headerlink" href="#rem-styles-of-operation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>From a procedural point of view, there are multiple alternative ways to deliver a message to a recipient.</p>
<p>One aspect is whether acceptance by the recipient is required before the consignment of the user content to the recipient occurs. In this aspect there are two alternatives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Acceptance is required: in this case the ERDS shall require the recipient to actively respond to the ERDS     before consignment, and shall consign the user content only if the response was positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance is not required: in this case the ERDS may perform the consignment of the user content without     waiting for any action of the recipient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another aspect is whether the user content is conveyed to the recipient by value or by reference. In this aspect the two alternatives are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By value: the complete user content itself shall be conveyed to the ERD-UA of the recipient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EXAMPLE 1: Sending a file in the body of an HTTP POST request.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2: Storing a file in the recipient’s mailbox, to be downloaded later by the email client via POP3.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By reference: a reference to the user content shall be conveyed to the ERD-UA of the recipient, and the     complete user content itself shall be forwarded or downloaded only upon a request of the recipient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EXAMPLE 3: Sending a link (URL) to a document stored on an online server in the body of an HTTP POST request.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4: Sending a link (URL) to a document stored on an online server in an email message.</p>
<p>The two aspects described above are independent, so in a general ERDS any combination of them could be applied. However, in REM only certain combinations are allowed, which are characterized by two styles of operation.</p>
<p>The two REM styles of operation are: «Store and Forward» (S&amp;F) and «Store and Notify» (S&amp;N).</p>
<p>In S&amp;F style the user content provided by the sender shall be conveyed to the recipient by value, and acceptance shall not be required. The action of the REM service provider which makes the user content available to the recipient is called consignment. Once the user content is consigned, no other action shall be required from the recipient to access the user content besides identification and authentication.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 5: This is typically performed by storing the user content in the recipient’s mailbox.</p>
<p>In S&amp;N style the user content provided by the sender shall be conveyed to the recipient by reference first, and acceptance shall be required. Acceptance may be implicit (e.g. downloading a document can imply accepting it). If the recipient accepts the message, then the user content shall be consigned (made available to the recipient).</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 6: This is typically performed by sending a notification (possibly on a different channel or even multiple channels, e.g. email, SMS, push notification) to the recipient about the incoming message, containing a reference (e.g. a URL) to the user content. At this point the user content is not yet accessible to the recipient. The recipient needs to respond to the notification (on any channel provided by the REMSP) and either accept or reject the incoming message.</p>
<p>A REMS shall support S&amp;F style of operation. A REMS may support S&amp;N style of operation.</p>

<p>A typical sequence of actions in S&amp;F style of operation is depicted in figure 2, and detailed below. For simplicity, failure cases are not considered in this sequence. (Success and failure cases are specified in the event types and possible reasons, see clause 6 below and ETSI EN 319 522-2 [i.5], clause 8.3.3.)</p>

<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the user content has been submitted. This is done producing an     «attestation of submission» (ERDS evidence of submission), e.g. a signed file containing the basic information     of the event.</p></li>

<p>NOTE: In steps 4, 7 and 11 sending the ERDS evidence right after its generation to the user is only one of the possible ways of providing the ERDS evidence, and there are other alternatives as well, e.g. the ERDS evidence can be stored by the REMS for later on-demand access, it can be forwarded to an external evidence repository, etc.</p>

<li><p>The REM service stores the user content (and optionally metadata and/or ERDS evidence along with it,     optionally enveloped in a REM dispatch) in a temporary storage where it is not accessible yet to the recipient,     and generates a notification for the recipient, containing a reference (e.g. a URL) to the user content.</p></li>
<li><p>The REM service sends the notification to the recipient. It can be sent as an ERD message or using any other     channel. Notifications sent through other channels (e.g. SMS, push notification) are outside the scope of the     present document.</p></li>

<li><p>The ERDS evidence of notification can be sent back to the sender. See note 2 below.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following part of the sequence depends upon the action of the recipient. One of three alternatives can occur:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the recipient accepts the message;</p></li>
<li><p>the recipient rejects the message;</p></li>
<li><p>the recipient does not respond within a predetermined time limit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the user content is addressed to multiple recipients, this applies to each recipient separately.</p>
<p>Alternative 1: if the recipient accepts the message:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li><p>The recipient (either a user or a system) authenticates herself to the REMS.</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient performs an action to confirm the acceptance of the incoming message by any means provided     by the REM service (e.g. sending a reply message, visiting a URL, clicking on a button, signing an     acknowledgment of receipt, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the message has been accepted by that particular recipient. This is done     producing a corresponding attestation (ERDS evidence of acceptance).</p></li>
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of acceptance, optionally along with additional data (e.g. acknowledgment of receipt     signed by the recipient), can be sent back to the sender. See note 2 below.</p></li>
<li><p>The REM service stores the user content in the recipient’s mailbox. It can also store additional related     information (metadata, e.g. sender’s identity, submission time, etc.) and ERDS evidence (e.g. ERDS evidence     produced in step 3, step 7, step 10 or step 11) along with the user content. These can be enveloped together in     one single bundle, called a REM dispatch, or can also be stored separately.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, the user content (and any accompanying metadata) can also be made available for download directly through the channel in which the acceptance was performed (e.g. on the website of the REMS). The user content is considered to be consigned regardless of the channel provided that it is available for the recipient any time upon proper authentication.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="14">
<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the user content has been made available to the recipient(s). Again, this     is done producing one or more attestation (ERDS evidence of consignment).</p></li>
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of consignment can be sent back to the sender. See note 2 below.</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient (either a user or a system) authenticates herself to the REMS.</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient (either a user or a system) retrieves the user content (either enveloped in a REM dispatch, or     separately), and optionally can also retrieve metadata and/or ERDS evidence (either enveloped in a REM     dispatch, or separately).</p></li>
<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the user content has been handed over to the recipient. In some cases,     this is done producing one or more attestation (ERDS evidence of handover).</p></li>
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of handover can be sent back to the sender. See note 2 below.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative 2: if the recipient rejects the message:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li><p>The recipient (either a user or a system) authenticates herself to the REMS.</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient performs an action to confirm the rejection of the incoming message by any means provided by     the REM service (e.g. sending a reply message, visiting a URL, clicking on a button, signing a statement of     rejection, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the message has been rejected by that particular recipient. This is done     producing a corresponding attestation (ERDS evidence of rejection).</p></li>
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of rejection, optionally along with additional data, can be sent back to the sender. See     note 2 below.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative 3: if the recipient does not respond within a predetermined time limit (see note 1 below):</p>
<p>9, 10. The recipient takes no action.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li><p>The REM service tracks the event that the predetermined acceptance time period for that particular recipient     has elapsed without any response. This is done producing a corresponding attestation (ERDS evidence of     no-response).</p></li>
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of no-response, optionally along with additional data, can be sent back to the sender. See     note 2 below.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE 1: The time period available for acceptance/rejection can be determined by legislation, policy rules, or parameters given by the sender. The method of determining this time period can be specified in the REM policy or REM practice statement of any provider providing S&amp;N style of operation.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: In steps 4, 8, 12, 15 and 19 sending the ERDS evidence right after its generation to the user is only one of the possible ways of providing the ERDS evidence, and there are other alternatives as well, e.g. the ERDS evidence can be stored by the REMS for later on-demand access, it can be forwarded to an external evidence repository, etc.</p>

<p>When the sender and recipient are clients of the same REMS then no further communication between different parties is needed, and clause 4.2 describes all the interactions that are subject to standardization. (Data flows and processing internal to one REMS is outside the scope of the present document.) However, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>When the sender and the recipient are subscribed to different REMSs then the respective REMSs communicate in order to forward the user content, along with some metadata associated to it, and to provide evidence to the users about every relevant event during the process. This communication may happen directly, in which case only 2 REMSs are involved. This 4-corner model is described in this clause. In other cases, the communication may happen indirectly, involving a number of intermediate REMSs as well, which is described in clause 4.4.</p>
<p>The interaction of the individual services of the REMSPs ensures the end-to-end user content delivery and evidence provision. The interface between the users of the services and the REMSs they communicate with is the same as described in the black-box model above.</p>
<p>This clause focuses on the interaction between two REMSs that communicate directly with each other, as illustrated in figure 4.</p>
<p>Figure 4: 4-corner REM model</p>
<p>Similarly to interconnected ERDSs in general, a shared infrastructure can assist the communication of interconnected REMSs. This is an abstract entity, which can consist of multiple distinct actors in reality. This can provide functions such as Message routing, Trust establishment, Capability management, Governance support, as described in clause 4.3.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1].</p>
<p>In REM, as required by clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 532-3 [i.2], the identifier of a user is an email address, which includes a domain specific part. The routing of REM messages may be based on the DNS records associated with the domain of the recipient address, just like in regular email messaging. In that case, it is possible that the Common user directory, as depicted in figure 4, is not necessary.</p>
<p>REMSs operating in different styles of operation may interoperate in a range of combinations, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>S&amp;F to S&amp;F, as described in clause 4.3.2.1;</p></li>
<li><p>S&amp;F to S&amp;N, as described in clause 4.3.2.2;</p></li>
<li><p>S&amp;N to S&amp;F, where a reference to the user content is relayed to the recipient’s REMS and delivered there     using a S&amp;F service, as described in clause 4.3.2.3;</p></li>
<li><p>S&amp;N to S&amp;N, where a reference to the user content stored by the sender’s REMS is relayed to the recipient’s     REMS, which normally operates in S&amp;N style. R-REMS shall recognize if the incoming message is a     notification, and in that case it shall act in S&amp;F style, i.e. it shall process the notification and notify the     recipient, and shall not generate another notification with a reference to the first notification. The message     flow in this case is identical to the one described in clause 4.3.2.3.</p></li>

<p>This clause describes the case when the sender’s REMS and the recipient’s REMS both operate in S&amp;F style in the handling of a particular user content.</p>
<p>A typical sequence of actions in S&amp;F to S&amp;F interaction is depicted in figure 5, and detailed below. For simplicity, failure cases are not considered in this sequence. (Success and failure cases are specified in the event types and possible reasons, see clause 6 below and ETSI EN 319 522-2 [i.5], clause 8.3.3.) The REMSs can track each relevant event in the sequence by producing a corresponding ERDS evidence, as detailed in clause 4.2.2.2, but for an easier overview, the production of these evidences is not shown in the figure 5. The produced evidence can also be sent to the user, or can be provided in other ways, as described in clause 4.2.2.2. The optional returning of evidence to users is not shown in the figure 5.</p>
<p>Figure 5: 4-corner S&amp;F to S&amp;F sequence</p>
<p>The interactions with the users are the same as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 for Store &amp; Forward style in the black-box model. Therefore, the indices of the actions relevant for the REM end users are kept the same as in figure 2. The new actions depicted in figure 5 are the communication steps between the REMSs, or in other words, communications internal to the REM delivery network. These are indexed with “N#”. The steps of the process are as detailed below.</p>
<p>NOTE: Steps N#. of the sequence are defined in a general way so that they can be reused in the extended model (see clause 4.4), where REM message relay is performed over a chain of multiple REMSs. The 4-corner model is a special case of this where only two REMSs are involved, namely the sender’s REMS and the recipient’s REMS.</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4. The user content is submitted, as in clause 4.2.2.2.</p>
<p>N1. Sender’s REMS (S-REMS) needs to find out how to reach the recipient’s REMS (R-REMS). In the general case this happens through a common infrastructure (Shared infrastructure). This is an abstract entity, which can correspond to several distinct actors. This step can involve multiple actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>S-REMS needs to determine the recipient’s REMS. This can be possible using the recipient’s mailbox     address, as an email address contains the provider domain.</p></li>
<li><p>S-REMS needs to find a mail route to the R-REMS. This can be possible using DNS lookups, as it is     done in the case of regular email messages, or using other techniques. In the 4-corner model (clause 4.3)     it is assumed that the REM message can be forwarded directly to R-REMS. In the extended model     (clause 4.4) it is assumed that the REM message is forwarded through a number of intermediate REMSs.</p></li>
<li><p>S-REMS needs to check the capabilities of the REMSs along the mail route (e.g. supported style of     operation, supported policies, etc.) in order to find a suitable route.</p></li>
<li><p>S-REMS needs to establish a trust relationship with the next-hop REMS along the mail route. This can     be done, for instance, using Trusted Lists, as defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [i.6].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>N2. The REMS performs a handshake with the next-hop REMS. This can include negotiation on different aspects (capabilities, supported style of operation, ERDS evidence, level of authentication of end entities, fees, etc.). Handshake can be omitted in closed systems where this information is defined a priori or available through a centralised infrastructure.</p>
<p>N3. The REMS relays the REM message to the next-hop REMS. It can also relay additional related information (metadata, e.g. sender’s identity, submission time, etc.) and ERDS evidence (e.g. ERDS evidence of submission produced in step 3) along with it.</p>
<p>N4. The REMS that received the relayed REM message can also look up the relaying REMS in the shared infrastructure, and get information (e.g. certificates), establish trust, etc.</p>
<p>N5. If the REM message has been successfully received and the validation of the relaying REMS reported no problems, then the REMS tracks this event by producing a corresponding evidence of relay.</p>
<p>N6. The evidence of relay is returned to the relaying REMS, as an indication that the responsibility of handling the relayed REM message has been taken over by the next REMS.</p>
<p>5, 6. The user content is consigned, as in clause 4.2.2.2.</p>
<p>N7. The ERDS evidence of consignment needs to be relayed back to the previous REMS along the mail route, so that it can close its transaction, and the sender might also need this attestation.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li><p>The ERDS evidence of consignment can be returned to the sender, as in clause 4.2.2.2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>8, 9, 10. The user content is handed over to the recipient, as in clause 4.2.2.2.</p>
<p>N8. The ERDS evidence of handover needs to be relayed back to the previous REMS along the mail route, in case the sender needs this attestation.</p>

<p>This clause describes the case when the sender’s REMS operates in S&amp;F style and the recipient’s REMS operates in S&amp;N style in the handling of a particular user content. The user content is relayed to the R-REMS in the same manner as detailed in clause 4.3.2.1.

<p>This clause describes the case when the sender’s REMS operates in S&amp;N style and the recipient’s REMS operates in S&amp;F style in the handling of a particular user content. Instead of the user content itself, at first the notification is relayed to the R-REMS in a manner similar to the relay of the user content as detailed in clause 4.3.2.1. The S-REMS performs the acceptance/rejection process of the S&amp;N style as described in clause 4.2.2.3, except that the user content is not consigned directly to the recipient’s mailbox but relayed to R-REMS first. (The user content can also be handed over directly to the recipient, but this is not detailed in this clause.) The notification is always handled by a S&amp;F subcomponent even if the REMS normally acts in S&amp;N style, so the sequence is the same also when the R-REMS operates in S&amp;N style.</p>
<p>A typical sequence of actions in S&amp;N to S&amp;F interaction which is also applicable in the S&amp;N to S&amp;N case is depicted in figure 7, and detailed below. For simplicity, failure cases are not considered in this sequence. (Success and failure cases are specified in the event types and possible reasons, see clause 6 below and ETSI EN 319 522-2 [i.5], clause 8.3.3.) The REMSs can track each relevant event in the sequence by producing a corresponding ERDS evidence, as detailed in clause 4.2.2.3, but for an easier overview, the production of these evidences is not shown in the figure 7. The produced evidence may also be sent to the user, or may be provided in other ways, as described in clause 4.2.2.3. The optional returning of evidence to users is not shown in the figure 7.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">1.12.4.1. </span>4.4.1 Functional viewpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the general scenario, the delivery process may go through several chained REMSs, as presented in figure 8. The interaction of the individual services of the REMSPs ensures the end-to-end user content delivery and evidence provision. The interface between the users of the services and the REMSs they communicate with is the same as described in the black-box model above.</p>
<p>This clause focuses on the interactions between the different REMSs in the case when more than 2 REMSs take part in the delivery process.</p>
<p>Figure 8: Extended REM model</p>
<p>When the sender and the recipient are subscribed to different REMSs then the respective REMSs communicate in order to forward the user content, along with some metadata associated to it, and to provide evidence to the users about every relevant event during the process. This communication may happen indirectly, involving a number of intermediate REMSs as well, which may provide routing assistance, trust gateway, and other auxiliary functions.</p>
<p>In the most general case a service provider acting as a REMSP could also be able to communicate using other formats and protocols which are different from REM, and thus provide interconnection with other types of ERDSs. An intermediate ERDS could also provide such protocol conversion, thereby acting as a gateway between a REM and a non-REM ERDS.</p>
<p>The present document (and also part 2 [i.1] and part 3 [i.2] of the present multi-part deliverable) describes the interactions between REMSs building on the email-based REM formats and protocols only. Communication with other non-REM ERDSs is out of scope of the present document. See ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1] for guidance in that area.</p>
<p>Similarly to interconnected ERDSs in general, a shared infrastructure can assist the communication of interconnected REMSs. This is an abstract entity, which can consist of multiple distinct actors in reality. In a multi-ERDS delivery scenario, some components which are normally implemented by an ERDS (dotted boxes in figure 8) can be moved to the shared infrastructure, like for instance: shared user directory, shared evidence repository.</p>
<p>Each of the REMSs involved in the delivery process may operate in S&amp;F or S&amp;N style (or may support both). However, in any chain of REMSs only one REMS may act effectively according to the S&amp;N style, since the notification shall always be handled by a S&amp;F sub-component. Therefore, all the REMSs along the chain after the first S&amp;N REMS shall behave as S&amp;F ones. The interactions between any two adjacent REMSs follow one of the patterns described in clause 4.3.2. If there is no S&amp;N REMS in the chain, then all interactions are as in clause 4.3.2.1. Otherwise, all interactions before (on the sender’s side of) the S&amp;N REMS are like in clause 4.3.2.2, and all interactions after (on the recipient’s side of) the S&amp;N REMS are like in clause 4.3.2.3. These two options are detailed in the next clause.</p>

<p>When all REMSs in the chain operate in S&amp;F style, the user content itself will be relayed along the chain to R-REMS, and the ERDS evidences will be relayed backwards along the chain to S-REMS. The interactions with the users are still the same as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 for Store &amp; Forward style in the black-box model. The communication between any two adjacent REMSs follows the pattern described in clause 4.3.2.1. The sequence of steps N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6. will be repeated as many times as needed to relay the user content. Steps N7. and N8. will be repeated individually as many times as needed to relay any ERDS evidence.</p>
<p>As an example, the complete flow of communications involving 3 REMSs, each operating in S&amp;F style, is depicted in figure 9. For simplicity, failure cases are not considered in this sequence. (Success and failure cases are specified in the event types and possible reasons, see clause 6 below and ETSI EN 319 522-2 [i.5], clause 8.3.3.) The REMSs can track each relevant event in the sequence by producing a corresponding ERDS evidence, as detailed in clause 4.2.2.2, but for an easier overview, the production of these evidences is not shown in figure 9. The produced evidence can also be sent to the user, or can be provided in other ways, as described in clause 4.2.2.2. The optional returning of evidence to users is not shown in figure 9.</p>

<p>When one of the REMSs in the chain operate in S&amp;N style, the user content itself will be relayed along the chain to this REMS, where it will be stored temporarily, and from there the REMS notification will be relayed along the chain to R-REMS. Any ERDS evidence will be relayed backwards along the chain to S-REMS. The interactions with the users are still the same as defined in clause 4.2.2.3 for Store &amp; Notify style in the black-box model. The communication between any two adjacent REMSs before (on the sender’s side of) the S&amp;N REMS follows the pattern described in clause 4.3.2.2, and the communication between any two adjacent REMSs after (on the recipient’s side of) the S&amp;N REMS follows the pattern described in clause 4.3.2.3. The sequence of steps N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6. will be repeated as many times as needed to relay the user content up to the S&amp;N node, and to relay the REMS notification from there up to R-REMS.

Steps N7, N8, N12 and N13. will be repeated individually as many times as needed to relay any ERDS evidence.</p>
<p>As an example, the complete flow of communications involving 3 REMSs, the middle one operating in S&amp;N style, is depicted in figure 10. For simplicity, failure cases are not considered in this sequence. (Success and failure cases are specified in the event types and possible reasons, see clause 6 below and ETSI EN 319 522-2 [i.5], clause 8.3.3.) The S&amp;N REMS can also hand over the user content directly to the recipient, but this is not shown in figure 10. The REMSs can track each relevant event in the sequence by producing a corresponding ERDS evidence, as detailed in clause 4.2.2.3, but for an easier overview, the production of these evidences is not shown in figure 10. The produced evidence can also be sent to the user, or can be provided in other ways, as described in clause 4.2.2.3. The optional returning of evidence to users is not shown in figure 10.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.13. </span>5 REM interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#rem-interfaces" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since REMS is a specific type of ERDS, the ERD interfaces described in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1] can also be applied to REM. However, in ERDSs the transport mechanisms can vary and therefore only a high-level abstraction of the interfaces is specified in ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1]. On the other hand, in REM the transport mechanisms are mostly based on regular email messaging, so a more fine-grained specification is given for REM interfaces in this clause.</p>
<p>Figure 11 illustrates the interfaces of the REM services. The 4-corner model is used for this illustration, but any REMS can provide all the presented interfaces. Detailed specification of the interfaces, and their relation to the abstract ERDS interfaces, is provided below in table 2.</p>

<p>REM MSI (Message Submission Interface)</p>
<p>ERDS MSI (Message Submission Interface): this interface is used by the sender’s ERD-UA to submit original messages to the sender’s ERDS, for them to be forwarded to the recipient(s). This interface shall require identification and authentication, either direct (e.g. through credential check) or indirect (e.g. though a token from a third party). This interface shall implement confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>The REM MSI shall be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements on ERDS MSI shall apply to REM MSI.</p>
<p>The REM MSI should be provided using SMTP [i.8] over TLS [i.11]. See also [i.13], [i.14] and [i.15]. Other protocols may be used only if they create a secure channel providing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data sent through the channel (e.g. TLS). Example: HTTPS creates such a secure channel.</p>

<p>REM MRI (Message Retrieval Interface)</p>
<p>ERDS MERI (Message and Evidence Retrieval Interface): this interface is used by the ERD-UA to retrieve user content, handover metadata and associated evidence (pull mode). This interface shall require identification and authentication, either direct (e.g. through credential check) or indirect (e.g. though a token from a third party). This interface shall implement confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>The REM MRI shall be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements on ERDS MERI shall apply to REM MRI.</p>
<p>The REM MRI should be provided using IMAP [i.10] over TLS or POP3 [i.9] over TLS. Other protocols may be used only if they create a secure channel providing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data sent through the channel (e.g. TLS). Example: HTTPS creates such a secure channel.</p>
<p>See note 2. REM ERI (Evidence Retrieval Interface)</p>
<p>The REM ERI shall be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements on ERDS MERI shall apply to REM ERI.</p>
<p>The REM ERI may use the same channel as the REM MRI, but may also use separate channels.</p>
<p>See note 2. REM RI (Relay Interface)</p>
<p>ERDS RI (Relay Interface): this interface allows ERD messages to be relayed between ERDS. This interface shall implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>The REM RI should be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements on ERDS RI shall apply to REM RI.</p>
<p>The REM RI should be provided using SMTP over TLS. Other protocols may be used only if they create a secure channel providing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data sent through the channel (e.g. TLS). Example: HTTPS creates such a secure channel. Implementation of this interface should follow the requirements defined in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 532-4 [i.3].</p>
<p>A REMS may provide more than one REM RI. The REM RI may be provided using other protocols. See note 3. REM ARI (Acceptance/ Rejection Interface)</p>
<p>This interface can be provided by non-REM ERDS as well, but it is not specified in ETSI ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1].</p>
<p>This interface is used by the recipient to respond to a notification and signal the acceptance or rejection of the incoming message.</p>
<p>The REM ARI shall be provided when the REMS operates in S&amp;N style.</p>
<p>The REM ARI may be provided using any techniques. The REMS should include in the REMS notification sufficient information so that the recipient can use the REM ARI.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ERD-UA MEPI (Message and     Evidence Push Interface)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In regular email messaging the user agent acts as a client towards the mail service provider. Hence, in REM pushing a message to an ERD-UA is not typical. For this reason, no corresponding REMS interface is defined for the ERD-UA MEPI. CSI (Common Service Interface)</p>
<p>CSI (Common Service Interface): this interface gives access to message routing functions, trust management functions, capability management functions, governance functions.</p>
<p>An interoperable REMS (which communicates with other REMS) should use CSI. CSI can be a set of distinct interfaces providing different functions. The REMS may provide some functions that can be used in place of the CSI (e.g. publication of capabilities, routing information, etc.).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Authentication in the REM MSI may rely on the features provided by SASL [i.12], TLS (e.g. certificate-based authentication), S/MIME [i.7] digital signature over the submitted message, or other mechanisms. NOTE 2: Authentication in the REM MRI and REM ERI may rely on the features provided by SASL [i.12], TLS (e.g. certificate-based authentication), or other mechanisms. NOTE 3: Providing a REM RI using other protocols can be useful when the REMS communicates with other non-REM ERDSs.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The REM MSI, REM MRI, REM ERI and REM RI interfaces are required to implement confidentiality preserving measures. Independently, the sender can ensure the confidentiality of the user content by applying end-to-end encryption before submission. In this case the confidentiality of the user content would have additional protection even outside the secure channels of these interfaces, and even REMSPs would not be able to read the user content.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The REMS will authenticate the sender and provide ERDS evidence associated to the authenticated user about the relevant ERD events. Independently, the sender can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the user content by applying a digital signature to it before submission. In this case the digital signature of the sender becomes part of the user content, and can give assurance to the recipient(s) in addition to that provided by the ERDS evidence.</p>

<p>A REMS may communicate with other REMSs or ERDSs in order to forward user content to recipients not subscribed to the REMS, or to deliver user content from senders not subscribed to the REMS. When a REMS interoperates with another REMS then it shall provide ERDS evidence corresponding to the events described in this clause.</p>
<p>Relay is the handing over of a REM message containing user content from one REMS (sending REMS henceforth) to another REMS (receiving REMS henceforth) through the REM RI (Relay Interface). When the REM RI is provided using SMTP then this transaction is an SMTP transaction.</p>
<p>After a successful relay of a REM message containing user content the REMSP operating the receiving REMS shall take over the responsibility of handling the user content according to the requirements in the present document and the policy rules. The receiving REMS may inspect the REM message to decide about its acceptance (e.g. it can verify trust in the sending REMS, check the compliance of the REM message with policy rules, etc.). The receiving REMS shall issue ERDS evidence about its decision over the relayed user content, and shall convey this ERDS evidence to the sending REMS.

<p>When a REMS operates in S&amp;N style or interoperates with another REMS operating in S&amp;N style then it shall provide ERDS evidence corresponding to the events described in this clause.</p>
<p>In the most general case the user content can be forwarded through a chain of REMSs. Only one of these can effectively operate in S&amp;N style (see clause 4.4.1) (notifying REMS henceforth). The notifying REMS shall generate the notification, and shall track the response of the recipient. A time period can be specified for the response of the recipient by legislation, policy rules or parameters given by the sender. The notifying REMS shall issue ERDS evidence about exactly one of the events regarding the response of each of the recipients (C.3, C.4, C.5 in table 5) for each user content.</p>
<p>The notification shall be relayed to the R-REMS. Upon receiving a notification addressed to one of its subscribers, R-REMS shall notify the subscriber. R-REMS may use any channel to notify the recipient. R-REMS should issue ERDS evidence about the successful or unsuccessful notification of the recipient (C.1, C.2 in table 5).</p>

<p>Consignment is the operation of R-REMS which makes the user content available to the recipient such that no other action is required from the recipient to access the user content besides authentication. Consignment is considered to be performed internally by the REMS, not through any outer interfaces. R-REMS shall issue ERDS evidence about the successful or unsuccessful consignment of each user content, regardless of whether it is consigned inside a REM dispatch or separately. If the user content was relayed by another REMS then the R-REMS shall make the ERDS evidence of successful or unsuccessful consignment available to the relaying REMS.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: Consignment can be performed by storing the message in a mailbox which the recipient can access with authentication.</p>
<p>When the REMS relays a user content to another REMS, it shall monitor whether the other REMS provides ERDS evidence of the successful or unsuccessful consignment of the user content within a given time period. If the other REMS does not provide such ERDS evidence within this time period then the REMS shall issue ERDS evidence about the failure of consignment, indicating the time period. If the user content was relayed by another REMS then the REMS shall make this evidence available to the relaying REMS.</p>
<p>NOTE: The time period available for the confirmation of successful or unsuccessful consignment can be determined by legislation, policy rules, or parameters given by the sender. The method of determining this time period can be specified in the REM policy or REM practice statement of the REMS.</p>
<p>R-REMS may optionally notify the recipient about the consigned user content. This may be done using any channel they agreed upon, it need not use any of the standardised interfaces. R-REMS may also issue ERDS evidence about the successful or unsuccessful notification of the recipient about the consigned user content.</p>

<p>Handover is the transaction in which the user content (either enveloped in a REM dispatch, or separately) passes through the REM MRI (Message Retrieval Interface) of the REMS, from the REMS to the recipient’s ERD-UA. The transaction involves authentication of the user performing the handover. In this transaction, related metadata and/or ERDS evidence may also be handed over along with the user content (either enveloped in a REM dispatch, or separately).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Handover is often performed using a user agent or other application, which connects as a client to the server providing the REM MRI.</p>
<p>When the REM MRI is provided using IMAP/POP3, then this transaction is an IMAP/POP3 transaction, which may involve handover of more than one message containing user content. When IMAP is used, fetching only the headers of the message (without the mail body) does not constitute handover. When the REM MRI is provided using HTTP, then download of the message by the HTTP client is considered as handover.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Historically, download of the message was defined to be a separate event from retrieval of the message. The present document considers those two cases as one, consequently there is no separate download event defined.</p>
<p>The REMS may issue ERDS evidence about the successful or unsuccessful handover.</p>

<p>The REMS may support interconnection with services that are not ERDS (e.g. physical mail, regular email, sectorspecific delivery system, etc.) and as such unable to provide ERDS evidence about the events occurring under their responsibility. When a user content is received from such a service or is relayed to such a service then it cannot be considered that the delivery of this user content has been provided by an ERDS. Still, in some cases allowing communication between such systems has value for the users and so can be desirable.</p>
<p>If the REMS supports this feature, it should issue ERDS evidence corresponding to the events described in this clause.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.8. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Business and administrative relationships among companies, public administrations and private citizens are the more and more implemented electronically. Trust is essential for their success and continued development of electronic services. It is therefore important that any entity using electronic services have suitable security controls and mechanisms in place to protect their transactions and to ensure trust and confidence with their partners.</p>
<p>Electronic signatures are commonly used worldwide to ensure authenticity and integrity of electronic documents, making it possible to transform traditional paper-based processes into electronic ones providing a comparable or even higher level of assurance. As communication is becoming predominantly internet-based, secure and provable exchange of documents is essential to the full digital transformation.</p>
<p>An electronic registered delivery service (ERDS hereinafter) provides secure and reliable delivery of electronic messages between parties, producing evidence of the delivery process for legal accountability. Evidence can be seen as a declaration by a trusted party that a specific event related to the delivery process (submission of a message, relay of a message, delivery of a message, refusal of a message, etc.) happened at a certain time. Evidence can be immediately delivered to the interested party (together with the message or separately) or can be kept in a repository for later access. It is common practice to implement evidence as digitally signed data. Registered electronic mail (REM hereinafter) is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, which builds on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging.</p>
<p>In a number of national, regional or sector-specific communities electronic registered delivery and registered electronic mail services are already in place, and even more are being developed. Without the definition of common standards there will be no consistency in the services provided, making it difficult for users to compare them. Under these circumstances, users might be prevented from easily changing to alternative providers, damaging free competition. Lack of standardization might also adversely affect interoperability between implementations which are based on different models.</p>
<p>The present document is one of a set of interrelated documents (framework of ERDS standards hereinafter) ETSI has produced to facilitate a consistent form of electronic registered delivery service inside and outside Europe, especially with regard to the form of evidence provided, in order to maximize interoperability even between domains governed by different policy rules. This set of documents includes the following deliverables:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 522 [i.10]: a multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Electronic Registered     Delivery Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 532 [i.11]: a multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Registered Electronic     Mail Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 521 [i.12]: providing Policy and Security Requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery     Service Providers.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI EN 319 531 [i.13]: providing Policy and Security Requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service     Providers.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI TS 119 524 [i.14]: a multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance and     Interoperability of Electronic Registered Delivery Services.</p></li>
<li><p>ETSI TS 119 534 [i.15]: a multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance and     Interoperability of Registered Electronic Mail Services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The documents covering ERDS contain the general concepts and requirements which apply to all kinds of electronic registered delivery services. Since REM is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, the documents covering REM service build on the corresponding documents covering ERDS by referencing the necessary provisions, and define the interpretation and specific requirements which apply only to registered electronic mail.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [i.2] (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or Regulation hereinafter) provides a legal framework to facilitate cross-border recognition between existing national legal systems related to electronic registered delivery services. That framework aims to open new market opportunities for European Union trust service providers to offer new pan-European electronic registered delivery services. The Regulation defines the so-called qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS hereinafter), which is a special type of ERDS, where both the service and its provider need to meet a number of additional requirements that the regular ERDSs and their providers do not need to meet.</p>
<p>The framework of ERDS standards aims to cover the common and worldwide-recognized requirements to address electronic registered delivery in a secure and reliable way, independent of the applicable legislative framework. The documents contain generic requirements which can be applied in any geographic region. At the same time, the framework of ERDS standards aims to support demonstrating compliance to the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (and related secondary legislation), both for non-qualified and qualified electronic registered delivery services. Specific clauses are included defining requirements for qualified services only, especially in the documents covering policy and security requirements. However, the legal effects of services implemented according to the framework of ERDS standards are outside the scope of the documents [i.10] to [i.15].</p>
<p>The present document is part 2 of ETSI EN 319 532 [i.11], which is a multi-part deliverable covering Registered Electronic Mail (REM) Services, as detailed in the Foreword. ETSI EN 319 522 [i.10] contains the general concepts and requirements which apply to all kinds of ERDSs. Since registered electronic mail is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, the general provisions given in ETSI EN 319 522 [i.10] apply to registered electronic mail as well. Hence, parts 1 and 2 of ETSI EN 319 532 [i.11] are aligned with ETSI EN 319 522 [i.11], and they reference the necessary provisions of the corresponding part.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.12.1. </span>4.1 ERDS and REM data structures<a class="headerlink" href="#erds-and-rem-data-structures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Registered electronic mail (REM) service is a specific type of electronic registered delivery (ERD) service.</p>
<p>The semantic content flowing across the interfaces of ERD services in general, as specified in clause 4 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1], shall apply to REM services as well. The present document specifies how to interpret the ERD concepts in the specific case of REM. The interfaces of the REM service shall comply with the requirements stated in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2].</p>
<p>The naming convention used in the present deliverable is the following. A term contains «ERD» or «ERDS» when it refers to a general concept defined by ETSI EN 319 522-1 [i.9] or ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1]. A term contains «REM» or «REMS» when it refers to a REM-specific concept defined in ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2] or in the present document. Terms referring to constructs whose content is completely generated by the service are prefixed with «ERDS» or «REMS», while terms referring to constructs whose content includes user generated data are prefixed with «ERD» or «REM».</p>
<p>The ERDS objects flowing across the interfaces can contain the types of information detailed below. Their interpretation in the REM specific case are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>user content: original data produced by the sender which has to be delivered to the recipient. This can consist     of one or more files. When the user content is submitted within an email message, the body of the message and     the body of all attachments - if any - are considered to be the user content.</p></li>
<li><p>submission metadata: data submitted to the electronic registered delivery service together with the user     content. This can include any accompanying information that the sender specifies in relation to the submitted     content. When the user content is submitted in the form of an email message, the headers of the message and     the headers of attachments - if any - are considered to be part of the submission metadata. This includes     headers specified by the sender and headers added by any servers the email passes through before reaching the     boundary of the sender’s REMS. Other data specified in the SMTP transaction (e.g. sender and recipient     addresses) are also part of the submission metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS relay metadata: data related to the user content which is generated by the electronic registered     delivery service for the purpose of relaying to another electronic registered delivery service. This may contain     a transformation of the submission metadata and also additional data. In REM the ERDS relay metadata is the     header of the relayed message (or any parts thereof).</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS evidence: data generated by the electronic registered delivery service, which aims to prove that a     certain event has occurred at a certain time. This is the same in REMS as for any other type of ERDS.</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS handover metadata: data related to the user content which is generated by the electronic registered     delivery service and handed over to the ERD user agent/application. When the user content is handed over in     the form of an email message, headers of the message (or any parts thereof) are considered to be part of the     ERDS handover metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ERD service builds up data structures using the above information for the purpose of storage or communication between ERDSs or with end users. The various data structures are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ERD message: data composed of an optional user content, ERDS relay metadata and zero or more ERDS     evidence. This is generated or assembled by the electronic registered delivery service. ERD message is a     collective term, which includes the following subtypes: ERD dispatch, ERD payload, ERDS serviceinfo,     ERDS receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>ERD dispatch: ERD message which contains the user content, some ERDS relay metadata and ERDS     evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>ERD payload: ERD message which contains the user content and some ERDS relay metadata. ERD payload     does not contain ERDS evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS serviceinfo: ERD message which contains only some ERDS relay metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS receipt: ERD message which contains ERDS evidence and some ERDS relay metadata. It does not     contain the user content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional data structure can appear on the interfaces of the ERDS, which is not built by the ERDS, but comes from the outside:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>original message: data including user content and submission metadata. For the purpose of submission, the     ERD user agent / application of the sender builds up a data structure, e.g. an email message. Any servers     forwarding the message can modify this before it reaches the systems of the ERDS (e.g. add extra headers,     correct format errors, etc.). The original message is the resulting data structure, which passes through the     ERDS MSI: Message Submission Interface provided by the sender’s ERDS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following objects specific for REM are introduced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>REMS introduction: data generated by the REMS containing information for the users about the data     structure it is included in. This may be formatted text or plaintext. This is intended to be displayed to the user     upon receipt of a REM message, and it can provide guidelines on how to interpret or use the various parts of     the content of the REM message.</p></li>
<li><p>REMS extension: data generated by the REMS in machine-readable form containing additional information     for other REMSs or the ERD-UA of users. The content and format of REMS extension can be defined by     application-specific or sector-specific rules; it is outside the scope of the present deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>REM envelope: signed data structure generated by the registered electronic mail service which contains any     of the REMS introduction, user content, ERDS relay metadata, ERDS evidence and/or REMS extension. The     REM envelope should be generated in the format specified in ETSI EN 319 532-3 [i.1]. The REM envelope     shall bear the digital signature of the generating REMS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All ERD messages can be structured as REM envelopes. Consequently, the following REM message types are defined:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>REM message: ERD message in the form of a REM envelope.</p></li>
<li><p>REM dispatch: ERD dispatch in the form of a REM envelope.</p></li>
<li><p>REM payload: ERD payload in the form of a REM envelope.</p></li>
<li><p>REMS notification: ERDS serviceinfo or ERDS receipt, in the form of a REM envelope, which includes a     reference to the user content to be delivered. A REMS notification shall not contain the user content. A REMS     notification may contain optional ERDS evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>REMS receipt: ERDS receipt in the form of a REM envelope. A REMS receipt shall not contain the user     content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If a REMS conveys ERDS evidence and also a reference to the user content in the same REM message then the REMS notification will be an instance of ERDS receipt. On the other hand, a REMS notification not containing ERDS evidence will be an instance of ERDS serviceinfo. A REMS receipt always contains evidence, so it is always an instance of ERDS receipt, but it does not contain a reference to the user content.</p>
<p>The basic components (REMS introduction, user content, ERDS relay metadata, ERDS evidence, REMS extension) within each of the subtypes of REM message that are used in REM (REM dispatch, REM payload, REMS notification, REMS receipt) shall have the cardinality as defined in table 1.</p>

<section id="id1">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.12.2.1. </span>4.2.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The clauses below show how the data structures specified in clause 4.1 typically flow between the sender, the recipient and the REMSs. The 4-corner model (see clause 4.3 of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2]) is used for this illustration, but this does not preclude the participation of more service providers in the delivery process, as in the extended model (see clause 4.4 of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2]). When more than two REMSs are involved, the same objects flow to or from any intermediate REMS as between S-REMS and R-REMS depicted in the figures.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-of-data-structures-in-store-and-forward-style">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.12.2.2. </span>4.2.2 Use of data structures in Store and Forward style<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-data-structures-in-store-and-forward-style" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Figure 1 shows the types of objects typically appearing on the interfaces when all REMSs are operating in Store and Forward style (see clause 4.3.2.1 of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2] for the sequence of messages in this case). The optional REMS extension components are not shown in the figure.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Typical flow of REM messages in Store and Forward style</p>
<p>In S&amp;F style objects relayed between REMSs through the REM RI: Relay Interface shall always be in the form of REM dispatch, REM payload or REMS receipt. Objects forwarded to the recipient through the REM MRI: Message Retrieval Interface should be in the form of REM dispatch or REM payload. Objects forwarded to the sender or recipient through the REM ERI: Evidence Retrieval Interface may be in the form of REMS receipt.</p>
<p>NOTE: The use of these REM messages between a REMS and its end users is only recommended by the present document, but not mandated (e.g. R-REMS is allowed to convey the user content and related ERDS evidence to the recipient in separate data structures).</p>
<p>When the user content is handed over to the recipient enveloped in a REM dispatch or REM payload, then the ERDS handover metadata is identical to the ERDS relay metadata, otherwise it can be different.</p>
<p>Different REM messages relating to the same user content may contain a different subset of the ERDS relay metadata relating to that user content.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-of-data-structures-in-store-and-notify-style">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.12.2.3. </span>4.2.3 Use of data structures in Store and Notify style<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-data-structures-in-store-and-notify-style" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Figure 2 shows the types of objects typically appearing on the interfaces when the sender’s REMS is operating in Store and Notify style (see clause 4.3.2.3 of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [2] for the sequence of messages in this case). Only those objects are shown in the figure that are used before the recipient responds to the notification. The optional REMS extension components are not shown in the figure.</p>
<p>Figure 2: Typical flow of REM messages in Store and Notify style</p>
<p>In S&amp;N style, before acceptance by the recipient, the object containing the reference to the user content relayed through the REM RI: Relay Interface by the S&amp;N REMS (S-REMS in the figure) and any subsequent REMSs to the next REMS shall be in the form of REMS notification. The object forwarded to the recipient by R-REMS in order to notify about the incoming message may be in the form of REMS notification, or it may be in any other form as agreed between R-REMS and the recipient.</p>
<p>If the recipient accepts the incoming message based on the notification then the REM dispatch or REM payload may be forwarded to the recipient in the same way as in S&amp;F style. The data structures used in this communication are as shown in figure 1. The same rules apply: the object forwarded between REMSs shall be a REM dispatch or REM payload, the object handed over by R-REMS to the recipient should be a REM dispatch or REM payload.</p>
<p>Alternatively, once the recipient signalled acceptance, the user content may be handed over by S-REMS directly to the recipient. (This option is not shown in the figures.) In this case, the object handed over to the recipient should be a REM dispatch or REM payload.</p>
<p>Objects forwarded to the sender or recipient through the REM ERI: Evidence Retrieval Interface may be in the form of REMS receipt.</p>
<p>When the sender’s REMS operates in S&amp;F style and the recipient’s REMS operates in S&amp;N style, the same rules apply as above, mutatis mutandis.</p>
<p>When the user content is handed over to the recipient enveloped in a REM dispatch or REM payload, then the ERDS handover metadata is identical to the ERDS relay metadata, otherwise it can be different.</p>
<p>Different REM messages relating to the same user content may contain a different subset of the ERDS relay metadata relating to that user content.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.13. </span>5 Identification of end entities in REM<a class="headerlink" href="#identification-of-end-entities-in-rem" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A REMS needs to generate, exchange and validate attributes to support the identification and authentication of end entities like sender, recipient or a delegate. All provisions for identification and authentication in ERDS specified in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1] shall apply to REM as well.</p>
<p>It is possible to provide REM service to users whose real-world identity is not established by the service provider. Even in that case, authentication of these users can be necessary, for instance in order to provide access to the mailbox or to provide access to evidence relating to a submitted user content.</p>
<p>In cases where the real-world identity of end users is established by the service provider, this identification can be performed in two manners:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>performing a full check of identity attributes and association with the real-world entity for each operation the user performs in the system; or</p></li>
<li><p>performing a full check of identity attributes and association with the real-world entity once at the time of enrolment, and issuing or registering a method for authenticating the user, which is then used in each operation the user performs in the system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>REMS may provide information on the assurance level and method of both initial identity verification and authentication.</p>
<p>Initial identity verification of end users performed at their enrolment is out of scope of the present document.</p>
<p>The protocols used by regular email and often used by REM services as well namely SMTP [i.4], IMAP [i.6] and POP3 [i.5] all support user authentication based on the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), defined in IETF RFC 4422 [i.8], and also support secure communication over TLS [i.7]. When authentication is performed based on SASL or TLS then the REMS should include in the authentication components sufficient information about the mechanism such that the reported level of assurance is justified.</p>

<p>The common service interface (CSI) is the abstract interface through which the shared infrastructure assisting the delivery in a multi-provider scenario is accessible. The shared infrastructure is an abstract entity, which can include several distinct actors. The Common Service Interface can include several distinct interfaces in reality, as different functions of the CSI can be provided by different entities. The CSI can be used, among others, for the four purposes described in clause 4.3.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-1 [i.9]:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Message routing.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>Capability management.</p></li>
<li><p>Governance support.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These purposes are described in the following clauses, with trust establishment and governance in the same clause.</p>
<p>It is possible to provide basic REM services with a lightweight shared infrastructure, consisting of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>routing information provided in public DNS, and</p></li>
<li><p>trust information provided in Trusted Lists, as defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [i.3].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If more sophisticated policy constraints or capability negotiations are needed then extensions to the above elements or further elements can be necessary in the shared infrastructure.</p>

<p>The requirements and explanations given in clause 9.2 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1] shall apply to REM, with the following amendments.</p>
<p>In REM, the identifier of a recipient is an email address. The REMS may use the Domain Name System (DNS) to find the server providing the REM RI (Relay Interface) of the REMS responsible for the domain identified in the domain part of the recipient’s address. The REMS may attempt to forward the REM message directly to the identified server, or may use a different routing strategy.</p>
<p>Multi-hop routing of a REM message via a path of one or more intermediate REMSs is out of scope of the present document.</p>
<p>NOTE: One possibility to configure such multi-hop routing is to ensure that DNS lookups, as described above, for the recipient’s domain by any server in the path always yield the next-hop server along the path.</p>

<p>Registered Electronic Mail (REM) is a particular instance of an «Electronic Registered Delivery Service» (ERDS). Standard email, used as backbone, makes interoperability smooth and increases usability. At the same time, the application of additional security mechanisms ensures integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation (of submission, consignment, handover, etc.), and protects against risk of loss, theft, damage and any illegitimate modification.</p>
<p>The present document aims to cover the common and worldwide-recognized requirements to address electronic registered delivery in a secure and reliable way. Particular attention is paid to the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.5]. However, the legal effects are outside the scope of the present document.</p>

<p>The present clause defines and explains how metadata and contents are formatted in REM messages. Schemas and format definitions of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [9] are reviewed in the REM perspective. Further implicit references are to ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4 describing the contents.</p>
<p>To define the formats involved in communication exchanges in the REM (and so email) scope, it is necessary to individuate and distinguish fundamental parts like user content and metadata components.</p>
<p>As outlined in ETSI EN 319 522-2 [8], clause 4, the user content is the content generated or provided by the sender, that is intended to be delivered to a recipient. Metadata related to the user content, e.g. in the case of submission, relay or handover events, are provided for purposes of handling and processing a message, e.g. message identification, identification of sender/recipient(s), or also for service capabilities discovery.</p>
<p>Annex A describes how these meaningful concepts have been mapped first in email and later in REMSs provision context starting with a description example for a graphical individuation of the components. Next clauses describe how ERD concepts are mapped on REM following with the format specifications.</p>

<p>In the context of email and REM services provision the concepts like user content and metadata have a correspondence with the elements of Mail Object as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14], clause 2.3.1 and with the definitions contained in ETSI EN 319 522-1 [7], clause 3.1, ETSI EN 319 522-2 [8], clause 4, and ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4.</p>

<p>user content user content This is the body of the Mail Object as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14], clause 2.3.1 (note 1). It is generated by the sender under the sender’s technical/legal responsibility. See also ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. submission metadata submission metadata This is the header section of the Mail Object as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14], clause 2.3.1. See Figure 1, Figure 4 and also definitions in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. original message This is composed of header + body as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14], clause 2.3.1. It is generated by the sender’s ERD user agent or under the sender’s technical/legal responsibility (and outside the responsibility of the service), which may be eventually digitally signed by the sender (note 1). See Figure 1, Figure 4 and also definitions in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4.</p>
<p>Root definition (from ETSI EN 319 522-2 [8])</p>
<p>REM equivalent definition</p>
<p>Detailed definition</p>
<p>ERDS relay metadata REMS relay metadata This is the header section (as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14]) of the REM message. Also the REMS introduction is considered part of the REMS relay metadata. See from Figure 1 to Figure 4 and also definitions in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. ERDS handover metadata</p>
<p>REMS handover metadata</p>
<p>The same of mapping of REMS relay metadata with the semantic defined in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. ERDS evidence ERDS evidence One of the methods usable to transport the ERDS evidence in REM is an attachment body part (as defined in IETF RFC 2045 [12]) of the REM message. See from Figure 1 to Figure 3 and also definitions in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. ERDS serviceInfo REMS notification See Figure 3 for the structure of this object and definitions in ETSI EN 319 532-1 [10], clause 3.1. The difference from ERDS serviceInfo is that a REMS notification always contains a reference to the user content. Furthermore, it may optionally carry the relevant evidence. ERD message REM message See from Figure 1 to Figure 4 for all the possible structures in parts (as defined in IETF RFC 2045 [12]). ERD payload REM payload See Figure 4 for the structure of this object and also definition in ETSI EN 319 521 [i.4], clause 3 and ETSI EN 319 522-1 [7], clause 3. ERD dispatch REM dispatch See Figure 1 for the structure of this object and also definition in ETSI EN 319 521 [i.4], clause 3 and ETSI EN 319 522-1 [7], clause 3 and further details in ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4. It is a new object (according to the REM message structure) generated by the REM Service enclosing the original message and other contents generated by the REM Service, who is responsible only for part of its contents (it is not responsible for the contents of the original message). transport metadata When the original message is submitted over SMTP, this is the transport information and the closure information conveyed in a typical SMTP session (see Figure A.1). It wraps the original message inside the SMTP transaction and it contains commands and answer information flowing during the client/server communication, as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [14] (note 2). NOTE 1: The term body, in the context of the present document, indicates also a «possibly structured» body part including one or more attachments, according to MIME standard specification, as provided in IETF RFC 2045 [12], clause 2.6. NOTE 2: Further considerations regarding specific protocol elements like transport and closure are out of scope for the present document and are managed in ETSI EN 319 532-4 [i.1], clause 5.3.5 CSI.</p>
<p>In the email ambit, (that is the basis of REM), the aforementioned concepts apply to the messaging stream.</p>
<p>Figure A.1 shows an example of where the constructs shown in Table 1 are located along the protocol stream.</p>
<p>An important feature specific for REM is that exactly the standard wrapping mechanism shown in Figure A.1 is also used to incorporate a digital signature into a REM message structure for getting a signed REM message (see Figure A.2). For example, in case of the REM dispatch, it is used to transport the original message together with the other REM message components as attachments and digital signatures, giving the possibility to make available the entire content in a comprehensible and usable way to all interested parties from the sender’s REMS up to the recipient (see Figure A.1).</p>
<p>See Figure A.2 as an example representing this further step, by showing the encapsulation of the original message in a REM dispatch and, similarly the previous example of Figure A.1, where it is located inside the protocol stream.</p>
<p>The same wrapping mechanism shall be used for enveloping the remaining objects relevant to the REM messages.</p>
<p>As the REM message contents are separated from the transport information/closure information parts in the communication stream, the entire set of REM messages as specified in the present document may also be properly transported by other underlying transport protocols.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: This separation ensures that REM messages are completely unrelated to the underlying protocol stream.</p>
<p>In fact, the underlying protocol only deals with the transport information and closure information of the stream and the REM message remains unchanged. All the REM logic is defined inside the REM message. This makes REM independent from the particular underlying transport protocol. In addition, as REM messages use this universal and standard enveloping, any standard email client of the initiator and/or the final users can process them.</p>
<p>The transmission of information between the sender’s REMS and recipient’s REMS typically happens according to the «attached» or «detached» forms. In the first case the original message is conveyed inside a REM dispatch. In the latter, it is transmitted using other means (e.g. by a REM payload). The ERDS evidence related to events occurred during the transfer of this original message is sent separately to the recipient, e.g. by a subsequent REM receipt.</p>
<p>The REM Service could add/modify some header fields to the submission metadata during the enveloping process. Anyway, these changes should be limited to what is proven as essential for the good working of the process and should be fully defined in the specific REM implementation.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Update of the Message-ID header field can be one of these changes (if it is not present or it needs to be normalized to a universal recognized identifier format, inside the context of the provided service). In such cases, the original identifier, if specified, is assigned to some new custom header field of the submission metadata and to the REM-UAMessageIdentifier: header field of the REM message. A new regularized and universal unique Message-ID is assigned to the submission metadata.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any of the aforementioned changes (additions/modifications of header fields) shall be clearly indicated to the sender and recipient of the REM dispatch or the REM payload.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The «REMS introduction MIME section» descriptive text see clause 6.2.3.4 is one of the places where the REMS can put such an indication. Alternatively, the contract with the users represents another place where the REMS can indicate this systematic practice.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.12.3. </span>4.3 REM message Structure Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#rem-message-structure-definition" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This clause specifies the structure of a REM message based on the MIME format (see IETF RFC 2045 [12]). A REM message does not exist as a self-standing object, since it always appears in the context of either a REM dispatch, a REMS receipt, a REMS notification or a REM payload.</p>
<p>A REM message may flow between different REMSs, and from a REMS to ERD user agents, as defined in ETSI EN 319 532-1 [10]. It is out of scope of the present document to define how the generic REM message is tailored to the specific mode of operation and interface it flows through.</p>
<p>See the description preceding Figure A.3 for examples of REM message components.</p>
<p>A REM message shall be structured as a message header section containing the header fields followed by a message body composed of several body parts as defined in MIME (IETF RFC 2045 [12]). The message body shall take the form of multipart signed/mixed/alternative MIME sections, in which every MIME-body-part is structured as defined in Figure A.3. This multipart/mixed MIME message shall constitute the signed MIME-body-part of a multipart/signed S/MIME message. The S/MIME signature contained in the last MIME part of the REM message shall therefore be the digital signature of the REMS over the rest of the MIME parts that appear in the REM message.</p>
<p>See Figure A.3 as an example representing this generic structure with all its elements. The different types of REM messages are built as indicated in Table 1 of ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4.1, which in turn is derived from Table 1 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [8], clause 4.</p>
<p>The REM dispatch shall be structured as in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The REMS receipt shall be structured as in Figure 2.</p>
<p>The REMS notification shall be structured as in Figure 3 and shall be generated by REMS according to the flow requirements of ETSI EN 319 532-1 [10], clause 4 and ETSI EN 319 532-2 [11], clause 4.</p>
<p>The REM payload shall be structured as in Figure 4.</p>
<p>They are built starting from the ERD message structure, defined in Table 1 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [8], clause 4, with the emphasis of REM specific aspects and peculiarities.</p>
<p>The cardinality numbers present in the boxes shall indicate the number of occurrences of any MIME part:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0..1 indicates an optional part;</p></li>
<li><p>0..N indicates an optional part that may occur any number of times;</p></li>
<li><p>Parts not otherwise indicated by cardinality numbers or remarked for clarity with 1 shall occur exactly once.</p></li>

<p>The REM RI (Relay Interface) should be identified by a transport protocol, a hostname and a port number.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: When the REMS uses SMTP for relay and uses DNS for routing, then for the target REM RI the protocol is implicitly SMTP, the port is implicitly 25, and the hostname is the one found in the MX record of the DNS when queried for the domain part of the recipient’s identifier (which has the format of an email address, see clause 5). The target REMS can provide multiple REM RIs, and so the DNS MX records can contain multiple hostnames.</p>
<p>Other techniques may be used either according to clause 6.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [9], peer-to-peer agreements between REMSPs or based on the best practices recommended in Annex A of ETSI EN 319 532-4 [i.1].</p>

<p>Header section (submission metadata) original message</p>
<p>Body (sender’s user content)</p>
<p>closure information</p>
<p>Figure A.1: Boundaries in email stream example</p>
<p>In the example of Figure A.1, fully compliant with IETF RFC 5321 [14], the original message represents the fundamental part examined in the present document.</p>
<p>For comparison with the definitions contained in ETSI EN 319 522, the transport information and closure information sections are separated and represent the «transport metadata».</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Further considerations regarding specific protocol elements like transport and closure are out of scope of the present document and are, in some measure, managed in ETSI EN 319 532-4 [i.1], clause 5.3.5 CSI.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Header section contains the submission metadata. Finally, the body section holds the user content.</p>
<p>From some viewpoint, also the subject and perhaps the addresses header fields could be considered part(s) of the user content (as contents that the sender specifies together the body of the message). This theoretical view is masked by applications, which are normally used by the sender like email client and/or webmail. To maintain coherence with widely recognized separation header/body sections, defined also in email international standards, and to simplify the exposition, these header fields are considered outside the user content and inside the header section.</p>
<p>Header section and body, together, form the original message and they represent the real object that is intended to be conveyed to the recipient(s). Therefore, the original message contains some metadata.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The main body part of the REM message is the place where to put some explanatory/introduction text indicating the composition of the message and / or elements to recognize the nature of the attachments (original message and / or ERDS evidence) and / or the description of eventual changes applied to some header fields of the submission metadata (see also Figure A.3). NOTE 2: The header section of the original message (originally called submission metadata) changes its nature after it is picked up by REMS and becomes part of the REMS relay metadata.</p>
<p>Figure A.2: Enveloping of REM dispatch in email stream example</p>
<p>The example of Figure A.2 illustrates how the same standard wrapping mechanism like that described in Figure A.1 is used to create the REM message structure. In case of a REM dispatch, this package is used to transport the original message as attachments.</p>
<p>So the original message is wrapped inside a body part of a new digitally signed message used to protect the sender’s message up to the recipient. Since the wrapping and the digital signature of the original message are realized by means of standard processes, the recipient is able to access (and verify the REMS digital signature) the sender’s message using standard email clients.</p>
<p>The REM message structure contains components for encapsulating ERDS evidence. Moreover, it is designed to contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>An introductory message-part displayed by the mail client application. Within this, the REMSP explains the purpose of the current message and gives some details on the other parts attached to. Eventually, also, if some element of the submission metadata has been modified (see note 2 and note 3 in clause 4.2). The actual message is also able to contain references to objects stored in a REMSP Repository.</p></li>
<li><p>A digital signature generated by the REMS. It covers both the original message, when present, and the ERDS evidence.</p></li>

</ol>
<p>NOTE 2: A possible use of one extension instance body part is to host an electronic time stamp, certifying the accuracy of the date and time of the event (sending, receipt or eventual changes) related to the current REM message. In such case, the current time stamp value (that is typically inside a structured information, as an example in a XML file), or the current time reference value is aligned with any date/time header field value of REM message and/or the ERDS evidence event time. It is not a good practice to have misaligned current time reference values among the significant time references (in any format, time zone etc. they are) present in each REM message. Another possibility is to host the time stamp in the signature as indicated in clause 8.3.</p>
<p>Figure A.3, without the grey part, presents the full skeleton of a generic REM message. When it includes the grey part (the original message MIME section), it represents the structure of a REM dispatch or a REM payload.</p>

<p>Registered Electronic Mail (REM) is a particular instance of An Electronic Registered Delivery Service (ERDS).</p>
<p>Standard email, used as a backbone, makes interoperability smooth and increases usability. At the same time, the application of additional security mechanisms ensures integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation (of submission,</p>
<p>consignment, handover, etc.). It protects against the risk of loss, theft, damage and any illegitimate modification. The present document covers the common and worldwide-recognized requirements to address electronic registered</p>
<p>delivery securely and reliably. Particular attention is paid to the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1]. However, the legal effects are outside the scope of the present document.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.9. </span>1 Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The present document specifies the interoperability profiles of the Registered Electronic Mail (REM) messages</p>
<p>according to the formats defined in ETSI EN 319 532-3 [6] and the concepts and semantics defined in ETSI EN 319 532-1 [4] and ETSI EN 319 532-2 [5]. It deals with issues relating to authentication, authenticity and integrity</p>
<p>of the information, with the purpose to address the achievement of interoperability across REM service providers, implemented according to the aforementioned specifications.</p>
<p>The present document covers all the options to profile REM services for both styles of operation: S&amp;N and S&amp;F.</p>
<p>The mandatory requirements defined in the aforementioned referenced REM services specifications are not normally</p>
<p>repeated here, but, when necessary, the present document contains some references to them.</p>
<p>More specifically, the present document:</p>
<p>a) Defines generalities on profiling.</p>
<p>b) Defines constraints for SMTP profile.</p>
<p>The present document also specifies a REM baseline supporting the technical interoperability amongst service providers in different regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>NOTE: Specifically but not exclusively, REM baseline specified in the present document aims at supporting implementations of interoperable REM services by use of Trusted List Frameworks to constitute Trusted domains and qualified REM services (instances of electronic registered delivery services) by use of EU Trusted List system as per Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1].</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.14.1. </span>5.1 General requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This clause defines a profile for interoperability among REMSPs based on SMTP relay protocol and the same formats. Under this basis, although many aspects described here are valid and reusable in other contexts, formats and protocols,</p>
<p>all the sentences of the present part of the document mainly refer to interactions among REM services providers using as a transfer protocol for REM messages SMTP and its related updates, extensions and improvements (e.g. ESMTP or</p>
<p>SMTP-AUTH, etc.).</p>
<p>In particular, the concepts defined in IETF RFC 5321 [7], clause 2.3.1 regarding envelope and content of the Mail</p>
<p>Objects, and the concepts defined in IETF RFC 5322 [8], clause 2.2 and IETF RFC 2045 [9] regarding the collection of header fields, structure, formats and message representation shall apply.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.14.2. </span>5.2 Style of operation<a class="headerlink" href="#style-of-operation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>From an interoperability standpoint, no impact is expected to occur because of the adopted style of operation by REMS</p>
<p>(Store-And-Forward vs Store-And-Notify). Therefore, the present document shall deal with both on the same profile.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that any REM message exchanged between two REMSPs (even REM messages that contain a</p>
<p>reference to the REM Object in a Store-And-Notify context) is conveyed using the Relay Interface that, within the present interoperability profile, is based on the SMTP protocol. Henceforth protocols, message formats and evidence</p>
<p>formats are the same in the two cases.</p>
<p>Then, all the REMS operating under the Store-And-Notify style of operation also need a REMS operating under</p>
<p>Store-And-Forward style of operation that represents a common layer between the two styles of operation.</p>
<p>Differences only arise in the set of mandatory evidence, which is specified within the two styles of operations, as</p>
<p>described in clause 5.5.</p>

Conditional d), e) see note 2 NOTE 1: The «Conditional» requirement category is used instead of that defined in table 1, with the meaning that the relevant requirement is subject to particular conditions made explicit in the implementation guidance. NOTE 2: Rationale: the sender needs to know if the sent message did not successfully reach or was rejected by the recipient’s REMS to enact possible backup measures.</p>
<p>Implementation guidance for 1 and 2:</p>
<p>a) RelayAcceptance and RelayRejection shall be generated if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>no opposite provision is explicitly specified in the applicable REMID rules;</p></li>
<li><p>no previous opposite agreement exists between the involved REMSPs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Such agreement or interoperability provision should specify one of the following:</p>
<p>I) The sender’s REMS will assume that the recipient’s REMS has rejected a REM dispatch or payload if any other contrary indication (e.g. REMS evidence and or SMTP DSN) is received within a predefined time period.</p>
<p>II) The sender’s REMS will assume that the recipient’s REMS has accepted a REM dispatch or payload if any other contrary indication (e.g. REMS evidence and or SMTP DSN) is received within a predefined time period.</p>
<p>Alternative conditions to I) and II) may be specified in the aforementioned agreement provided that these conditions deal with the relay transaction closure with an exhaustive method.</p>
<p>b) If the evidence type is considered mandatory, the recipient’s REMS shall send back to the sender’s REMS a REM receipt, including the RelayAcceptance or the RelayRejection evidence.</p>
<p>c) In the cases addressed in previous item 1, the sender’s REMS shall build a REM receipt including either one or both of the RelayRejection evidence and any other contrary indication to the relay, like SMTP DSN, and shall send it back to the sender.</p>
<p>Implementation guidance for 3:</p>
<p>d) RelayFailure shall be generated if there is no explicit requirement against its generation within REMID.</p>
<p>Such interoperability requirement should specify:</p>
<p>III) The sender’s REMS will assume that is impossible to relay a REM dispatch or payload to the recipient’s REM, if any contrary indication (e.g. REMS evidence and or SMTP DSN) is received within a predefined time period.</p>
<p>Alternative conditions to III) may be specified in the requirement above provided that these conditions deal with the relay transaction closure with an exhaustive method.</p>
<p>e) The sender’s REMS shall build a REM receipt, including either one or both of the RelayFailure evidence (and any other contrary indication to the relay, like SMTP DSN) and shall send it back to the sender.</p>

<p>The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] defines a set of principles promoting the directions that emerged from the EU Digital Agenda and the subsequent conclusions of the European Council. The objectives of such principles are</p>
<p>oriented to counteract &lt;&lt;…the lack of interoperability and the rise in cybercrime…&gt;&gt; through &lt;&lt;…cross-border use of online services …by creating appropriate conditions for the mutual recognition of key enablers across borders, such as</p>
<p>… electronic delivery services, …&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>The present informative annex provides a set of rationales used as context for the normative Annex C. The aim is to</p>
<p>introduce the REM baseline, a «baseline» set of requirements leading the implementation and configuration of REM services facilitating the fulfilment of the principles as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>REM baseline specifies a minimal set of requirements aiming to ensure maximal interoperability in the cross-REM interoperability domain and, specifically, in cross-border use of REM services. Compliance with REM baseline aims to</p>
<p>simplify technical support of REM by Member States competent authorities supporting qualified registered electronic delivery services. Without common baseline requirements, the technical support of REM can be very costly and</p>
<p>challenging.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of a system compliant with the requirements specified in the present document are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is a «non-closed» system (see note 1).</p></li>
<li><p>Easy verification methods are available.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear access points and rules for interoperability are also available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 1: The set of participants is not restricted nor predefined.</p>
<p>The present document deals in detail with trust, protocol handshake, digital signatures and time-stamp. This annex</p>
<p>focuses attention on the boundary key elements to fulfil, as widely as possible, amongst others, the aim/requirement of eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] expressed in recital 66: «facilitate cross-border recognition between existing national legal systems related to electronic registered delivery services». In other words, digital signatures and</p>
<p>time-stamps answer to the question «what» is cross/shared among system[s], and Common Service Interface (CSI) answers the question «how» to interoperate in such digital messaging ecosystem; finally, the eIDAS Regulation (EU)</p>
<p>No 910/2014 [i.1] constitutes one of the «why». Answering both «what» and «how» questions, a great deal of care is</p>
<p>placed aiming to satisfy this «why».</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The REM baseline aims to facilitate compliance with the eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1], but the full legal value and the relevant legal effects are out of its scope.</p>

<p>The building of a mutually trusted set of REMS is a fundamental step for achieving interoperability. The present clause</p>
<p>provides all the rationales to get this point. For detailed requirements on trust establishment applied in REM baseline, see clause C.2.3.3.</p>
<p>Table B.2: Trust domain and policy rationales</p>
<p>Nº Statement Reference Derived rationales 1 «Trust is defined as the existence of a trust domain within which co-operation between participating ERDSs is regulated…., trust infrastructures may be used to establish trust. In this case, the trust infrastructure, i.e. the trust domain, shall have governance, at least for policy regarding conditions for an ERDS to join</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.1</p>
<p>The concept of trust domain (see figure B.2) is defined to substantiate a trust. In the REM context the REM interoperability domain (REMID) concept is used to identify a particular subset of a trust domain (possibly the whole) where all participants REMSs are interoperable (see figure B.3, figure B.4 and figure B.5). A trust domain policy (as per statements 2, 5 and 6 at side) can also include provisions for ensuring that all the participants have the same capabilities. In such a case, the trust domain would be a REMID. The REM baseline defined in the present document specifies the provisions for technical interoperability (see figure B.5). If the trust domain policy does not include provisions for technical interoperability, still one or more REMIDs can be defined within the trust domain, each one with its own set of provisions for technical interoperability, for the providers that meet such provisions. A trust domain is subjected to governance (which, among other provisions, defines rules for joining to the trust domain), carried by a so-called scheme operator.</p>
<p>A REM interoperability domain (REMID) is subject to governance (which, among other provisions, defines rules for joining to the REMID, the definition of and operation to REMID policy), carried by a so-called REMID authority.</p>
<p>2 A trust domain may require specific policy, security, and technical conditions to be met by all participating ERDSs. If this is the case, the capabilities of the participating ERDSs may be implicit from the participation in the trust domain. In other cases, both trust in and capabilities (metadata) of the other ERDS shall be assessed</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.3</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a trust domain Trust Status List (TSL), typically a responsibility of an actor co-ordinating the trust domain, termed the «scheme operator» by ETSI TS 119 612 []. An X.509 certificate represents the «service digital identity» of the ERDS in the TSL.</p></li>
<li><p>As a special case of TSL, the European Trust List system will list ERDSs which are qualified in the sense of eIDAS Regulation []; and the trust domain may be defined as «all qualified ERDSs».</p></li>

<p>5 An ERDS shall not relay an ERD message to another ERDS unless it can assess that the other ERDS can provide a service respecting the constraints and options defined in the applicable ERD policy. The assessment may be based on both ERDSs participating in the same trust domain (see clause 9.3) if the trust domain policy ensures that all participating ERDSs have the same capabilities</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.4.4</p>

<p>A REM interoperability domain (REMID) is composed of a set of REMSs that enjoy the property to be interoperable. In particular, it can coincide with the entire trust domain when all participants REMSs are interoperable.</p>
<p>Figure B.5: Trust domain policy</p>
<p>The interoperability among a set of REMSs is practicable when all REMSs have the same capabilities. The trust domain</p>
<p>policy can ensure that all participating REMSs to a trust domain have the same capabilities. In this case, such a trust domain is a REMID.</p>
<p>All the REMIDs that comply with the REM baseline are interoperable.</p>
<p>Figure B.6: Governance of trust domain policy</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: considering the rationales of table B.2 and summarizing:</p>
<p>As illustrated in figure B.6 a trust domain is regulated by a «trust domain policy».</p>
<p>For the purpose of REM baseline, the governance is operated by «scheme operator» regarding the policy and conditions for a REMS to join the trust domain. The Scheme Operator is the entity in charge of establishing, publishing, signing and maintaining the Trusted Lists (see table B.3 and table B.6 for the details). Whereas regarding the policy and conditions for a REMS to join the REMID (among others, the adherence to the REMID policy), the REMID authority operates the governance. The REMID authority is the entity in charge of signing and maintaining the REMID policy.</p>

</ul>
<p>Trust domains, established by use of the EU Member States Trusted List Framework (named also EU Trusted List system in the standard, see statement 1 at side) take the benefits of an infrastructure already deployed. This property, together the rationales of the present column contribute in the normative part of Annex C, for the definition of the REM baseline. Under this basis, and as per statement 2 in row 2, column 2, REMSs have the status of qualified trust service when listed as qualified within EU Trusted List system.</p>
<p>A qualified REMSP is listed with the ServiceTypeIdentifier Svctype/EDS/REM/Q</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>qualified electronic registered mail delivery services QREMSs. The establishment of a trust domain is an abstraction aiming to capture, amongst others, the intention of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] that all qualified trust services are trusted. In fact, a trust domain is not directly specified, with a tag or a specific element for example, in TL entries but, at the most, it is indirectly referenced in TL by the ServiceTypeIdentifier element. The most general trust domain, of the two first bullets of the statement 4 of the first column, including all qualified trusted services is «All QERDSs». This trust domain includes:</p></li>
<li><p>Svctype/EDS/Q - qualified     electronic registered delivery     services QERDSs; and</p></li>
<li><p>Svctype/EDS/REM/Q - qualified     electronic registered mail     delivery services QREMSs So, «All QERDSs» definition (that is a term used only in EU) includes also the services registered for the trust domain «All qualified REM services».</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence of the aforementioned rationales all the qualified REMSs registered according to the EU TL element with ServiceTypeIdentifier set to http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/R EM/Q are trusted by definition and also belong to «All QERDSs» trust domain.</p>
<p>NOTE: On the side, clarifies that the adhesion to the «All QERDSs» (that by design includes both EDS/Q and EDS/REM/Q) means having qualified services. Whereas interoperability is matter of technology and the capabilities choices.</p>
<p>4 Where Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [] is in force, the following trust domains may be established:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All QERDSs shall be trusted, meaning all     services registered according to the two     first bullet points above.</p></li>
<li><p>All non-REM QERDSs shall be trusted,     meaning all services registered according     to the first bullet point in the previous list.</p></li>
<li><p>All qualified REM services shall be trusted,     meaning all services registered according     to the second bullet point in the previous     list.</p></li>
<li><p>To any of the trust domains in the previous     bullet points, add non-qualified ERDSs     and/or non-qualified REM services listed     in the EU Trusted List system that shall be     trusted. NOTE 1: The intention of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 is that all qualified trust services are trusted. A different question is to what extent the Regulation requires QERDS providers to trust one another for ERD message relaying. It may be argued that a trust domain consisting of all QERDSs (the first bullet point above) is reasonable, and that the technology dependent trust domains of qualified non-REM or REM services (second and third bullet points) are not relevant since these are restrictions that are a matter of capabilities of the QERDSs rather than lack of trust.»</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.2</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The REM baseline can be established by a TL with different provisions outside the EU Member States Trusted List framework.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: considering, together, the rationales of table B.2 and table B.3 and summarizing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A trust domain (and so also «All QERDSs» trust domain) is constituted by defining of the membership     properties and conditions for a REMS to join.</p></li>
<li><p>A REM interoperability domain (REMID) is a subset of the trust domain where the participants meet a set     of provisions to have the same capability for achieving technical interoperability. A REMID can be the trust     domain if the trust domain policy includes the provisions as mentioned earlier (see also figure B.5).</p></li>
<li><p>The provisions specified in the REM baseline, allows to build a REMID.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 2: These conditions include the definition of a REMID within the «All QERDSs» trust domain. Therefore, this REMID would be formed by qualified and interoperable REMSP (see figure B.7).</p>
<p>Figure B.7: REMID of qualified, trusted and interoperable REMSs</p>
<p>Further details on Trusted List structure are useful to introduce the rationales that connect REM concepts with TL usage</p>
<p>possibilities.</p>
<p>As defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12] the Trusted List have a set of components in a structured relationship. Essentially:</p>
<p>Schema (1..1)</p>
<p>TSPs (1..n)</p>
<p>SERVICEs (1..n)</p>
<p>A TSP is mainly structured as follows:</p>
<p>INFORMATION (4 elements)</p>
<p>TSP information extensions (1..n)</p>
<p>A SERVICE is mainly structured as follows:</p>
<p>INFORMATION (8 elements)</p>
<p>Service information extensions (1..n)</p>
<p>As further specified in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.5.7 the Service Supply Point can be used to provide specific</p>
<p>service-related information.</p>
<p>In particular, for REM baseline, the Service Supply Point is used to reference an XML document containing the</p>
<p>technical information and conditions regarding the service capabilities (see table B.9 for details).</p>
<p>Table B.4: Trust establishment and digital identities rationales</p>
<p>Nº Statement Reference Derived rationales 1 «The service digital identity element (tsl:ServiceDigitalIdentity/tsl:DigitalId) of a (Q)ERDS in the EU Trusted List system shall be one of the following: 1) A single certificate used by the ERDS for digital signing of all ERD messages and ERD evidences.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>A single CA certificate that shall be used solely for the purpose of issuing certificates to components of the ERDS for digital signing of ERD messages and/or ERD evidences.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Use of a single signing certificate as service digital identity is only applicable where the ERDS is a centralized service, or where it is feasible to replicate the private key corresponding to the certificate to all components of the ERDS where digital signing will take place.</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.2</p>
<p>TL allows in its structure only one (or more than one, but with identical subject and representing the same public key) per service digital identity certificate. This implies that even if a subordinate CA certificate, having the purpose mentioned in statement 1, seems the suitable choice as service digital identity, in the case of ERDS, it is not always the best option. Firstly (due to its flexibility and cost efficiency) it is better to use, as service digital identity, the certificate used for ERD messages and ERDS evidence signatures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, signatures with certificates issued in the path of a Root CA certificate (having a general scope) represent often the reality. But it is unlikely that these Root CA certificates have the required purpose mentioned in statement 1.</p>
<p>It follows that it would be make sense that the service digital identity certificates are issued by a subordinate/intermediate CA certificate (issued and in the path of a general Root CA as per the previous indent), having the purpose mentioned in statement 1.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, the derived rationale is that, for the purposes of the REM baseline, the service digital identities are represented in TL only by single terminal leaves certificates. See also best practice in clause D.2.2 for other details on type of certificates and certification path that are out of scope with regards to the interoperability.</p>
<p>2 When a CA certificate is used as service digital identity, this may be a root CA or subordinate CA certificate, and there may be a hierarchy of subordinate CAs underneath the CA. An ERD message or ERD evidence digitally signed using a subject certificate that has a path to the CA certificate used as service digital identity shall be regarded as being digitally signed by the ERDS. I.e. all subject certificates issued under this CA are authorized to sign ERD messages and ERD evidences on behalf of the ERDS.</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.2</p>

<p>Table B.7: Capability and metadata rationales</p>
<p>Nº Statement Reference Derived rationales 1 «Capability management provides the functionality to resolve the unique identifier of a recipient into: 1) Identification of the R-REMS of which the recipient is a subscriber 2) Metadata for the capabilities of the identified REMS 3) Metadata for the capabilities of the recipient in the R-REMS</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 532-2 [5], clause 9.4.1</p>
<p>The concepts involved in these rationales are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>REMS metadata and REMS capability</p></li>
<li><p>Recipient’s metadata and recipient’s capability</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of the present rationales is to identify the «capabilities» that represents the basis for interoperability.</p>
<p>It is noted that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Only the capabilities at REMS level are interesting     for interoperability (see note 1).</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient’s email address represents the link     from S-REMS to R-REMS. And this element is part     of the recipient’s metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to statement 1 at the side, the unique identifier of a recipient (through Capability management) is mapped to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the identifier of R-REMS and</p></li>
<li><p>the metadata of R-REMS (used to specify the     R-REMS capabilities);</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to statement 3 at side, the relay of a REM message from S-REMS to R-REMS requires an assessment on constraints and options respected by both REMSs, and exhibited by their capabilities. This assessment is implicitly ensured if both S-REMS and R-REMS have the same capabilities; nevertheless, it needs to be in some way validated with a specific process (see note 2).</p>
<p>The CSI (through capability management) provides these mapping functionalities to individuate R-REMS capabilities.</p>
<p>As outlined in the CONCLUSIONS on pages 29 and 31: a particular trust domain policy with the additional provisions ensuring the same capabilities (for REMSs that will adopt it) can regulate a REM interoperability domain (REMID).</p>
<p>The capabilities, common to all REMSs of the abovementioned REMID, are collected and referenced from EU Trusted List without the need of extensions of the Trusted List scheme (see table C.6 of clause C.2.3.4.1 and table C.8 of clause C.2.3.4.2 for the implementation).</p>
<p>2 Recipient metadata The capabilities of a recipient may be implicit from the ERDS metadata; the conditions for becoming a subscriber of an ERDS may require all subscribers to fulfil certain requirements. […omissis…] When recipient metadata is used, the CSI shall provide functionality to derive a unique address for the recipient’s metadata, e.g. a URI, from the recipient identification. Recipient metadata repositories may be organized in different manners: 1) One metadata repository may be provided for an ERDS; when the ERDS is identified, all metadata for its subscribers will be in one place 2) […omissis…] 3) […omissis…]</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.4.3</p>
<p>3 ERDS capability metadata An ERDS shall not relay an ERD message to another ERDS unless it can assess that the other ERDS can provide a service respecting the constraints and options defined in the applicable ERD policy. The assessment may be based on both ERDSs participating in the same trust domain (see clause 9.3) if the trust domain policy ensures that all participating ERDSs have the same capabilities.»</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.4.4</p>
<p>NOTE 1: It is unnecessary to consider the user’s capability for REM baseline interoperability purposes. It is noted that user’s capability verification is simplified when the capabilities are grouped at the service level. According to statement 2 above, the capabilities of a recipient can be implicit from the R-REMS metadata; the conditions for becoming a subscriber of a REMS can require all subscribers to fulfil certain requirements. So, in this case, the service capabilities also represent the subscribers” capabilities. This property is important just in case any of these subscribers capabilities would affect the interoperability. At the level of REM baseline, there are not provisions to manage users capabilities. NOTE 2: This is necessary during the «once only» registration phase at the REMID authority, but also, as a further consistency validation step, during the day-by-day run-time recognition phases of R-REMS from S-REMS.</p>
<p>Table B.8: Capability referencing in TL for publication rationales</p>
<p>Nº Statement Reference Derived rationales 1 «If the REMS uses TL to publish trust information about itself, the REMS capability metadata may also be published using the TL, as indicated for ERDS capability metadata in clause 7.2 of ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 []. In this case the options given in Table 14 may be used. [see next statement nr. 2]</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 532-3 [6], clause 9.4</p>
<p>For REM baseline REMS capability metadata have to be referenced by TL and made accessible, in a downloadable form, by the ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL.</p>
<p>See table B.9 for details on downloading rationales.</p>
<p>Statement 1 at side specifies that a REMS, when using TL to publish trust information, can also use Trusted List to publish REMS capability metadata. To avoid any extension to the TL schema, the necessary information for the implementation of the REM baseline are published by reference, indirectly.</p>
<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) mechanism (on the REMS ServiceEndpoint represented by the ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL, as seen in rationales of table B.5) is based on a set of security information (namely: security metadata or REMS capabilitybased security).</p>
<p>So, with a similar mechanism like that used for REMS capability metadata, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) digital certificate of REMS, as part of REMS capability-based security, can be made accessible by reference, in a downloadable form, by the ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation, see table C.5 of clause C.2.3.3.2 for the requirements about the ServiceSupplyPoint, clause C.2.3.4.1 for the capabilities general requirements, clause C.2.3.4.2 for the specific part of REMS capability metadata and clause C.2.3.4.4 for the specific part of REMS capability-based security.</p>
<p>2 [Options from table 14 of 532-3]</p>
<p>If present, the additionalServiceInformation field, as per clause 5.5.9.4 of ETSI TS 119 612 [], may contain a URI, where the REMS capability metadata is downloadable, or alternatively, it may embed the REMS capability metadata structure itself (if it is in XML format).»</p>

<p>Table B.9: Capability downloadable from TL rationales</p>
<p>Nº Statement Reference Derived rationales 1 «ERDS metadata may be published as a service information extension in a TSL according to clause 5.5.9 of ETSI TS 119 612 []</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 6.3.2</p>
<p>For REM baseline REMS capability metadata have to be downloadable by the ServiceSupplyPoint field of TL Service information element (see figure B.8).</p>
<p>Since the ServiceSupplyPoint TL element is per-service, the capabilities are closely bound to REMS (and not to the scheme level). To ensure the same capabilities on the trust domain relevant to the REM baseline, all the REMS capability metadata have to be the same for all the REMSs that meet the requirements of REM baseline.</p>
<p>So, with regards to REMS capability metadata (clause C.2.3.4.2) and, similarly, as introduced in table B.8 rationales, for REMS capability-based security (clause C.2.3.4.4), the ServiceSupplyPoint TL element represents the URI where to download the whole XML structure, for capability and security metadata information (see figure B.8 and clause C.2.3.4.1).</p>
<p>See table C.5 of clause C.2.3.3.2 for the implementation details regarding the ServiceSupplyPoint.</p>
<p>2 5.6.6 Service information extensions Presence: This field is optional. Description: It may be used by TLSOs to provide specific service-related information, to be interpreted according to the specific scheme’s rules, with the Format and Value used in clause 5.5.9.»</p>

<p>In REM, the metadata related to the user content is represented by the «header section» of the original message: the submission metadata (See ETSI EN 319 532-3 [6], figure A.1). Inside submission metadata, there is the recipient of the REM message. The domain part of the recipient’s email address is used to individuate the R-REMS capabilities (see the derived rationales of table B.7).</p>

The domain part of this email address shall identify the REMS responsible for that domain (of which the recipient is a subscriber): R-REMS. If the REMS supports receiving relayed messages from other REMS (i.e. it can act as I-REMS or R-REMS in a chain of REMSs) using SMTP, then the REMS should ensure that the hostname of the server providing the REM RI is available in MX records of the DNS to all other REMSs, which need to relay messages to this REMS. The hostname provided should be the same as the one included in a URI contained in the Service supply point of the TL entry (see clause 9.3 of ETSI EN 319 532-3 []), if the REMS uses TL to publish trust information about itself and the Service supply point element is present.</p>
<p>ETSI EN 319 532-2 [5], clause 9.4.2</p>
<p>The individuation of the recipient’s REMS is implemented using the domain part of the recipient’s email address of a REM message.</p>
<p>The hostname configured in MX records of such domain is the same configured in the ServiceSupplyPoint element of the Trusted List for that REMS.</p>
<p>See table C.5 of clause C.2.3.3.2 for the REM baseline implementation details.</p>
<p>2 9.4.2 Resolving recipient identification to ERDS identification The R-ERDS may be explicitly identified by the identifier of the recipient, e.g. when this is on an email format receiverID&#64;ERDS.domain. When the identification of the recipient is by other means than an identifier, identification of the ERDS may be explicit by a separate parameter (in submission metadata). However, a recipient may also be uniquely identified by an identifier (scheme name and value, see clause 5.2) that is not bound to identification of the R-ERDS, or by a set of identity attributes that together provide unique identification, see clause 5.3, and without identification of R-ERDS as separate parameter; e.g. the sender may not know which ERDS that serves the recipient. In this case, either: 1) the S-ERDS may be able to locally decide the identity of the R-ERDS, e.g. based on identifier scheme name or specific identity attributes like country; or 2) the R-ERDS may be identified through lookup in recipient metadata; as stated above, further parameters in submission metadata may be used in the identification of the R-ERDS.»</p>

<p>The present clause illustrates the approach adopted in identifying the solutions defined in clauses C.3 and C.4 to address the digital signatures and time-stamp application requirements in REM messaging. The definitions of digital signatures</p>
<p>and time-stamp application connote a strong impact in terms of interoperability. For this reason, this subject is dealt with starting in a general way, covering the lack of common rules with other e-delivery services.</p>
<p>One of the key points to address interoperability is the format of the exchanged data and the evidence (in essence: «what» it is exchanged, by whom and how to prove it).</p>
<p>The data format is addressed by definition in REM data structures since it uses a widespread email and standard format. The evidence leverages the ERDS evidence structure to use it as an auto-consistent pivot, virtually sharable among</p>
<p>potentially different e-delivery solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, new ERDS elements are defined to cover certain peculiarities of REM baseline. These are adequate to hold</p>
<p>information that makes it possible to discriminate and correctly manage the variability of determined situations over the course of execution of the flows in their completeness.</p>
<p>For such information that cannot be hosted in the canonical data structures, extension mechanisms (placeholders) are provided inside the basic ERDS evidence set of components. The necessary elements are added through these</p>
<p>extensions (see the derived rationales from statement 8 of table B.13).</p>

<p>R-REMS inspects the REM dispatch to decide its acceptance (verify trust in the sending REMS, check the compliance</p>
<p>of the REM dispatch with REMID policy rules, security etc., as specified in clause C.2.3.3.3).</p>
<p>R-REMS issues ERDS evidence about acceptance/rejection of the REM dispatch, attaches the ERDS evidence to a</p>
<p>REM receipt and conveys this REM receipt to the S-REMS.</p>
<p>Figure B.10: Detailed relay acceptance event example (R-REMS side)</p>
<p>If the relay of a REM dispatch has failed then the S-REMS is responsible for issuing an ERDS evidence about the</p>
<p>failure of the relay, attaching the ERDS evidence to a REM receipt and convey this REM receipt to the sender.</p>
<p>Figure B.11: Detailed relay rejection/failure events example (S-REMS side)</p>
<p>NOTE: The dotted lines without arrows between REM dispatch, Relay Rejection Event REM receipt and ERDS evidence XML structures have the meaning that the M02 ERDS evidence element is the same in any place, and so it represents a correlator among these three elements.</p>

<p>b.2.1.1) A trust domain within which a fully regulated co-operation among participating REMSs shall be defined for trust establishment according to ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.1 (see the derived rationales from statement 1 of table B.3 and statements 1 and 4 of table B.2).</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: The trust domain defined for the qualified electronic registered mail delivery services is established as «All QERDSs» trust domain, according to ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.1 (see the derived rationales from statements 3 and 4 of table B.3).</p>
<p>b.2.1.2) The information about participants to the trust domain defined for electronic registered mail delivery services shall be found by a Trusted List; and in the case of qualified REM services, by the use of EU Trusted List system that lists REMSs in the sense of eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] (see the derived rationales from statement 1 of table B.3 and statements 1 and 4 of table B.2).</p>
<p>b.2.1.3) The Trusting Interface, part of CSI trust infrastructure, allowing the co-operation among participants to the trust domain defined for electronic registered mail delivery services shall be implemented by use of a Trusted List; and in the case of qualified REM services, by the use of EU Trusted List system according to ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.1 (see the derived rationales from statement 1 of table B.3 and statements 1 and 4 of table B.2).</p>
<p>b.2.1.4) The trust domain of the electronic registered mail delivery services shall require specific policy, security and technical conditions to be met by all participating REMSs. The capabilities of the participating REMSs shall meet the requirements of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.3 (see the derived rationales from statement 2 of table B.2 and clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The REMS are not obliged to be interoperable because they are qualified.</p>
<p>b.2.1.5) When trust domain policy does not include provisions for technical interoperability, its achievement shall require the specification of a REMID policy with security and the technical requirement that each REMS is obliged to fulfil to ensure technical interoperability among REMSs participating to the REMID, established according to the requirements b.2.1.1, b.2.1.2, b.2.1.3, b.2.1.4 and ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.1 (see the derived rationales from statements 1 and 6 of table B.2).</p>

<p>To establish trust in a REMS based on information in a TL, an actor, which could be another REMS, shall validate:</p>
<p>Pre-relay R-REMS validations (at sender-side level) according to the specular steps defined in clause C.2.3.3.2:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>verify the existence of a valid DNS MX record associated with the recipient’s email domain;</p></li>
<li><p>verify that the aforementioned MX record is set as ServiceSupplyPoint TL element of a REMS;</p></li>
<li><p>verify the compliance of the ServiceTypeIdentifier TL element of such REMS to the expected type of service, according to the requirements of the applicable trust domain;</p></li>
<li><p>verify that the service current status TL element of such REMS is «granted»; and</p></li>
<li><p>verify the presence of a valid X.509 digital certificate on the service digital identity (ServiceDigitalIdentity).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Post-relay S-REMS validations (at recipient-side level) according to ETSI EN 319 522-4-3 [11], clause 7.2:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the REMS’s digital signature on a REM message or ERD evidence;</p></li>
<li><p>verify that the signing certificate can be linked to the service digital identity (ServiceDigitalIdentity) in the TL;</p></li>
<li><p>verify that the service current status is «granted»; and</p></li>
<li><p>verify that the ServiceTypeIdentifier TL element is set according to the requirements of the applicable trust domain.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If this process is applied to evaluate trust in the past, the process shall use the information (signature validity and service</p>
<p>information in the TL) that was valid then.</p>
<p>NOTE: Other run-time verifications further detailed for compliance in REMID policy are possible and make sense for coherence with REM specification. Hence some further note is given as best practice in clauses D.4.2, D.4.3 and D.4.4.</p>

<p>NOTE 3: The schema above uses the explicit method of local caching of any XSD namespace needed to be imported to avoid the impact of reloading the schema from the internet every time (consider that in production systems, the validation processes can require hundreds of checks per second, and the download is not practicable). Anyway, the original and canonical location is specified as XML comment just before the import for the once-only first download, or to set always, as location, just in case it is considered favourable.</p>
<p>c.3.1.7) The root element of XSD Capability and security information structure illustrated in point c.3.1.6 shall be CapabilityAndSecurityInformation.</p>
<p>i. CapabilityAndSecurityInformation shall have «EN319532v1» as value for version attribute.</p>
<p>ii. Attribute Id shall be used to reference the CapabilityAndSecurityInformation element.</p>
<p>c.3.1.8) The SchemeData element is composed as follows:</p>
<p>i. The content of CSIVersionIdentifier element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.1 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation instead of the TL scheme.</p>
<p>ii. The content of CSISequenceNumber element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.2 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation instead of the TL scheme.</p>
<p>iii. The CSISchemeOperatorName and the CSISchemeOperatorAddress elements shall specify the name and the address of the REMID authority, entity in charge of managing the CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme.</p>
<p>iv. The CSISchemeInformationURI element shall specify the URI(s) where relaying parties can obtain the master copy of the specific information regarding CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme; and CSISchemePolicyCommunityRules element shall specify the URI(s) where relaying parties can obtain the master copy of the scheme’s policy (namely REMID policy) information with the security and technical requirements for the achievement of interoperability.</p>
<p>v. The content of the CSIPointerToTL element shall reference the location where the current and applicable TL is published, at the country level, by the TLSO.</p>
<p>vi. The content of CSIIssueDateTime element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.14 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme instead of the TL one, transposing the role of TLSO to the REMID authority and according to the REM baseline REMID policy (see clause C.2.3.5 and clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>vii. The content of CSINextUpdate element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.15 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme instead of the TL one, according to the REM baseline REMID policy (see clause C.2.3.5 and clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>NOTE 4: This element represents the date and time by which, at the latest, an update of the CapabilityAndSecurityInformation information structure occurs. The update can happen anytime when necessary (e.g. status changes, etc.) But if no changes occur, this structure is re-issued at the CSINextUpdate time to reduce the risks of substitution by an attacker with an old structure. Structures with CSINextUpdate occurring in the past are discarded.</p>
<p>viii. The content of CSIDistributionPoints element shall specify the location where the present capability and security information XML structure is published and where the relevant updates can be found. This element has a semantic like that of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.16, but applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme instead of the TL one.</p>
<p>ix. The content of CSIPointersToOtherMetadata element shall specify a list of references to the historical publications of the capability and security information XML structure. Once an XML file is obsoleted by a new one, it shall be published in the present historical list of the new one, through a URI composed of a fully qualified domain name in the host section and an absolute path without a query section. The name of the XML file shall be the SHA-256 hash value of the binary representation of the XML file itself, as it can be retrieved by resolving the aforementioned URI, adding the «.xml» file extension at the end of the absolute path.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>Content of CSIPointersToOtherMetadata element of the new file:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="tns:CSIPointersToOtherMetadata">tns:CSIPointersToOtherMetadata</a> &lt;/tns:CSIPointersToOtherMetadata&gt; <a class="reference external" href="tl:URI">tl:URI</a>https://rem-provider-1service.cc/13bf128113ff2fb9d3607d897c6f403dc440278fcb914b8978c17bd812d03f49.xml&lt;/tl:URI&gt; <a class="reference external" href="tl:URI">tl:URI</a>https://rem-provider-1service.cc/378aa0e499cd37741f919226409b1d6efb67a6850d107ea77743ced7cdd0d9ed.xml&lt;/tl:URI&gt; &lt;/tns:CSIPointersToOtherMetadata&gt;</p>
<p>The published obsolete files (with content similar to that illustrated in figure C.2) are the followings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>«13bf128113ff2fb9d3607d897c6f403dc440278fcb914b8978c17bd812d03f49.xml» (already obsoleted)</p></li>
<li><p>«378aa0e499cd37741f919226409b1d6efb67a6850d107ea77743ced7cdd0d9ed.xml» (new obsoleted)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and, the current new file, when and in case it is obsoleted by another one, it is published with the same mechanism of the two above, and its SHA-256 digest value is added to the CSIPointersToOtherMetadata of the new one. At the first issue the CSIPointersToOtherMetadata element is empty.</p>
<p>NOTE 5: This historical list is necessary for security purposes (e.g. to support verifications after the change of digital certificates presents therein the present XML structure), and it not restricted to the last one. The number of saved historical elements is specified in the REMID policy (see clauses D.1.3 and D.3).</p>
<p>x. The CSISchemeExtensions (capability and security information) optional element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.17 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme.</p>
<p>c.3.1.9) The CapabilityMetadata element is composed as follows:</p>
<p>i. The ERDSMetadata element shall be that defined in ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause A.1 (see point c.3.2.31 of table C.7 for other requirements on this element).</p>
<p>ii. The CISchemeExtensions (capability information) optional element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.17 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme.</p>
<p>c.3.1.10) The SecurityMetadata element is composed as follows:</p>
<p>i. The CapabilityBasedSecurity element shall be that defined in point c.3.4.3 of table C.10.</p>
<p>ii. The SISchemeExtensions (security information) optional element shall have the semantic of TL element defined in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.3.17 applied to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation scheme.</p>
<p>c.3.1.11) The Signature element shall be a XAdES-B-B baseline digital signature as specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1 [14]. The REMID policy may specify, once the XAdES-B-B baseline signature has been generated if it should be also subject to time-stamp (e.g. through a XAdES-B-T baseline signature level, by incorporation into the digital signature of the unsigned attribute signature-timestamp, containing a time-stamp token computed as specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1 [14], clause 6). See clause D.1.3.</p>
<p>c.3.1.12) With regards to the point c.3.1.11, the certificate supporting the validation of the signature on the document shall either be one of the certificates used as digital identity of the REM service or be a certificate, issued to the REMSP, for which a valid certification path can be established to one of the certificates used as digital identity of the REM service, or a certificate issued to the REMID Authority.</p>
<p>NOTE 6: In all points above having options, from points c.3.1.7 to c.3.1.12, there can be additional rules, in local REMID policy, that dispose of particular usage of such options for specific functions or operation practices, as specified in the policy (see clauses C.2.3.5 and D.1.3). None of these «additional» functions or operation practices breaks the interoperability.</p>

<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>c.3.2.1) The REMS capability metadata shall be made accessible, by reference, within one ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL according to ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 5.5.7 (see the derived rationales of table B.7, table B.8 and table B.9 of clause B.2.2.4, and the statement c.3.4.1 of table C.10 since it represents the same anchor point, in TL, for both forms of capabilities/metadata).</p>
<p>NOTE: The ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL is defined on a per-service basis. So, the capabilities referenced from such field are closely bound to REMS (and not to the scheme level).</p>
<p>c.3.2.2) The REMS capability metadata, referenced by ServiceSupplyPoint element, shall be the same, as specified in clause C.2.3.4.3, for all adherent REMSs, to ensure the same capabilities for the trust domain relevant to the REM baseline (see rationales of c.3.2.1).</p>
<p>c.3.2.31) ERDSMetadata XML structure shall be located at CapabilityAndSecurityInformation/CapabilityMetadata path, in order to reference the capability metadata, according to ETSI EN 319 532-3 [6], clause 9.4 (see the structure at c.3.1.6 of table C.6 and the rationales of c.3.2.1):</p>

<h5><span class="section-number">4.25.3.4.3. </span>C.2.3.4.3 Capability metadata Consistency and validation steps<a class="headerlink" href="#c-2-3-4-3-capability-metadata-consistency-and-validation-steps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>The present clause addresses the implementation of the expression having the «same capabilities» used in the referenced</p>
<p>standard (see ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.4.4).</p>
<p>The capabilities extensions are specified by a set of fields (elements and attributes), each one expressed by a list of tag/name and content/value assertions. The property of having the «same capabilities», between two such lists is</p>
<p>implemented through a specific comparison of all those assertions.</p>
<p>NOTE: A special comparison process is necessary because some of the elements (e.g. ERDSDomain) has a specific value for any REMSP. So the ERDSDomain value of a certain REMSP is different from that of another one. But this does not mean that the capabilities of the first REMSP are different from the capabilities of the second one.</p>
<p>This specific comparison process is therefore named «equivalence»; and the equivalence between two generic capability</p>
<p>structures shall be achieved by applying the requirements of table C.9 (a key point of the validation process necessary</p>
<p>for the check/assessment mentioned in ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 9.4.4 as explained in the derived rationales of table B.7).</p>
<p>Below follows a detailed description of table C.9:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the first column contains a progressive identifier;</p></li>
<li><p>the second column contains capability elements and attributes coming from the formal definition of ERDSMetadata structure;</p></li>
<li><p>the third column contains the indication if the either the specified element tag (in case of XML elements) or the attribute name (in case of attributes of the elements) has to be considered in the equivalence process;</p></li>
<li><p>the fourth column contains the indication if either the specified element content (in case of XML elements) or the attribute value (in case of attributes of the elements) has to be considered in the equivalence process;</p></li>
<li><p>The fifth column informs where there is the implementation guidance with the fulfilment details of the referenced element or attribute.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The rationale of the equivalence criteria is to verify the capabilities according to the following matching requirements with either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the equivalence shall be verified when both tag/name is «present» and content/value is «equal» if the     element/attribute has both third and fourth column selected; or</p></li>
<li><p>the equivalence shall be verified when only of tag/name is «present» (without regards to the content/value) if     the element/attribute has only the third column selected.</p></li>

<p>NOTE 1: See the derived rationales of table B.7, table B.8 and table B.9 of clause B.2.2.4, and the statement c.3.2.1 of table C.7 since it represents the same anchor point, in TL, for both forms of capabilities/metadata.</p>
<p>c.3.4.2) The REMS capability-based security information, relevant to the «basic handshake», referenced by ServiceSupplyPoint element, shall be the same, as specified in clause C.2.3.4.5, for all adherent REMSs, to ensure the same capabilities for the trust domain relevant to the REM baseline (see note 1).</p>
<p>c.3.4.3) REMS CapabilityBasedSecurity XML structure shall be located at CapabilityAndSecurityInformation/SecurityMetadata path, to reference the security metadata (see the structure at c.3.1.6 of table C.6 and the rationales of note 1):</p>
<p>The CapabilityBasedSecurity element is defined at <a class="reference external" href="http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1.1.7/CSI19352v117-">http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1.1.7/CSI19352v117-</a></p>

<p>3.5 TL Clause 9.4 M c.3.5.1) Capability-based security</p>
<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>c.3.5.1) The TLSCertificate element of CapabilityBasedSecurity shall contain the X509Certificate used for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) mechanism of REMS SMTP ServiceEndpoint, for the basic handshake.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: It is important to have the TLS certificate ensured by an anchor in the Trusted List. The sender’s REMSP needs to be sure that the contacted REMS, resolved by DNS lookup, is the intended server. This is ensured using the TLS handshake and by the subsequent secure matching between the server’s certificate and the TLS certificate anchored by the Trusted List. The domain resolved by DNS is not always (indeed almost never) the same domain contained in the service’s certificate. For example, in the case of a REMS managing thousands of email domains, these are resolved by DNS to the MX records. So only the MX record hostnames are configured inside the certificate Subject Alternative Name, not all the thousands of managed domains. The TLS, certificate certifies the MX records hostnames. The full coverage against security threats is implemented by: DNS, TLS plus TLS certificate anchored in Trusted List. Possible MOTM attacks are detected right through the TLS certificate ensured in TL and not solely by TLS standalone certificate checks.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The present version of REM baseline does not specify the optional elements DomainSignCertificate and CBSSchemeExtensions.</p>
<p>See below an excerpt of CapabilityAndSecurityInformation XML with an example of CapabilityBasedSecurity</p>
<p>referenced from ServiceSupplyPoint element of TL for the basic handshake.</p>

<p>4 Policy 9.3 M a), b), c), d) Governance support</p>
<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The governance, operated by the REMID authority, should address at least the following tasks:</p>
<p>I. Publication of the REMID policy denoting the adoption of the REM baseline and the required additional technical condition (e.g. regarding operation details like security, timeouts, historical retentions, certificate details or similar which do not break interoperability). See some other information in clauses D.1.3 and D.2.2.3.</p>
<p>II. Ensuring the publication of the Capability and Security Information from any REMS adhering to the REMID.</p>
<p>III. Ensuring the referencing of the Capability and Security Information required to implement the REMID, from the supporting Trusted List System through the ServiceSupplyPoint element (see clause C.2.3.4).</p>
<p>b) The URI used for the publication of the REMID policy and the additional information required by REM baseline shall be set to the CSISchemePolicyCommunityRules element of CapabilityAndSecurityInformation XML structure (see point iv./c.3.1.8 of table C.6, clause C.2.3.4.1 and clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The published information is a set of data for governance and consultation purposes that is typically defined initially and infrequently changed.</p>
<p>c) The data used for automatic run-time operations should always be a «cached» copy of the «master» ones maintained in TL and CapabilityAndSecurityInformation distribution points. That information is used by applications in machine-processable way to ensure trust and interoperability. In any case, any Service Provider should download the «master» copy from TL and CapabilityAndSecurityInformation, to align own «cached» copy, according to practices already recommended for TL operations (see also clauses D.3 and D.4).</p>
<p>d) The operations practices for TL illustrated in ETSI TS 119 612 [12], clause 6 shall apply to CapabilityAndSecurityInformation as well according to the REMID policy and with the roles properly transposed into the context of the REMID. In particular, REMSPs shall publish, at the same locations where they publish their CapabilityAndSecurityInformation XML file, a SHA-256 hash of such file as it can be retrieved from CSIDistributionPoints URI. The hash shall be published with the same CSIDistributionPoints URI but replacing the «.xml» file extension, at the end of the absolute path, with «.sha2» (see also clauses D.3 and D.4).</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The mechanism, as mentioned earlier is used, by REMSPs, in combination with that defined in point ix./c.3.1.8 of table C.6, clause C.2.3.4.1. The file with extension «.sha2» contains a digest of the current version. Those illustrated in point ix., with the digest values in the filenames, refer to the historical capability information.</p>

The GeneralEvidenceInfo element is defined at http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1.1.7/EVIDENCE19352v117-202201.xsd (see clause C.3.3 at point c) of table C.17 for a top-level illustration of the whole XML structure container of the extensions).

Each UntrustedPathToRecipient child element identifies, with a integer reference, the recipient among all the recipients whose reachability by CSI is not verified. &lt;/xs:documentation&gt; &lt;/xs:annotation&gt; <a class="reference external" href="xs:sequence">xs:sequence</a> &lt;xs:element name=»Subject» type=»xs:string» minOccurs=»0»/&gt; &lt;xs:element name=»UntrustedPathToRecipient» type=»xs:integer» minOccurs=»0» maxOccurs=»unbounded»/&gt; &lt;/xs:sequence&gt; &lt;/xs:complexType&gt; …</p>
<p>b) The GeneralEvidenceInfo extension element shall contain the following elements:</p>
<p>i. Subject element shall be used, when specified by the sender, to capture the subject of the original message as per the semantic defined in ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clauses 6.2.14 and 8.2.24, elements MD14/M02.</p>
<p>ii. UntrustedPathToRecipient element shall identify, when the present event occurs, the recipient(s), among all the intended recipients, whose reachability is not insurable through the CSI trust &amp; security mechanisms (even if it results practicable with the canonical SMTP flow). For matching an integer value with one of the intended recipients, the first RecipientDetails child element in the list of recipients shall be assigned the number 1.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: This mark can be used as a valid advice for the sender (since the SubmissionAcceptance ERDS evidence) in overt cases of «not ensured recipients» to the REM baseline circuit (e.g. recipients of ordinary email whose domains are instantly recognized by CSI mechanisms as not ensured). But in some cases, the converse is not generally true. A REM message can be sent to an «unregistered» recipient but with an email domain/path perfectly ensured by CSI. In this case, the UntrustedPathToRecipient mark is not set in the SubmissionAcceptance ERDS evidence (and so the sender is initially led to believe that the recipient is «ensured» to the REM baseline circuit). Indeed the sender is informed later that the intended recipient is «unregistered» to Recipient’s REMS. Sender’s REMS receives a RelayReject for the «unregistered» recipient and, in turn, Sender’s REMS issues a RelayFailure, with the same warning, for the sender. So to be sure that a recipient is «ensured/registered» to the REM baseline circuit, it is necessary to wait for the cycle completion with either the ContentConsignment or the RelayFailure evidence. Again, UntrustedPathToRecipient mark does not represent, in itself, an error condition, nor it is necessarily used together with negative reason codes.</p>

<p>1 ERDS evidence Clause 8 M a), b), c), d) Top-level requirements</p>
<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The ERDS evidence instances incorporated as attachments in any REM message shall be composed by a selection of the necessary elements, from the full list in ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 8, according to the presence and cardinality requirements defined in table C.27 of the clause C.4.5.4 (see the derived rationales from statement 8 of table B.13).</p>
<p>b) The collection of elements constituted according to the previous point a) shall be implemented through an XML structure fully defined by the following three sections:</p>
<p>i. an XSD wrapping skeleton composed of the namespace definitions and a suitable ordered list of imports, useful for any section in the XSD;</p>
<p>ii. the main ERDS evidence XSD scheme section (see ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause A.1);</p>
<p>iii. the ERDS Extensions XSD scheme section (see clause C.3.2 and next point c) for the implementation).</p>
<p>c) The whole XML structure container of ERDS evidence, constituted according to the previous points i., ii. and iii. shall be implemented through the REM baseline XML scheme definition for ERDS evidence, defined at http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1.1.7/EVIDENCE19352v117-202201.xsd, of which a fragment significant in the present clause is copied below for information. The XML Schema files shall take precedence in case of discrepancies between the XML schema excerpts provided in the present document and the XML Schema files.</p>

Anyway, the original and canonical location is specified as XML comment just before the import for the once-only first download, or to set always, as location, just in case it is considered favourable.</p>
<p>d) The root element of XSD structure for ERDS evidence, constituted according to the previous points a), b) and c) shall be Evidence, and the value of version attribute shall be «EN319522v1.1.1».</p>

<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The EvidenceIdentifier element shall be a UID generated according to IETF RFC 5322 [8], clause 3.6.4.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: This element can be set to the same value of the Message-ID header of the REM message (upon which the ERDS evidence will be attached) whenever it is possible. But this is not generally true. In fact, in the case of SubmissionAcceptance event, this cannot be possible: the ERDS evidence is the same for both REM dispatch and REM receipt, and thus such two REM messages, being two distinct messages, cannot have the same Message-ID value.</p>
<p>b) The version attribute shall be set to «EN319522v1.1.1».</p>
<p>c) The ERDSEventId element shall be one of the URI of table 2 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.5 according to one of the events foreseen for REM baseline and illustrated in clauses C.4.5.1, C.4.5.2 and C.4.5.3. (see the item G03 of table C.27 for the full list of admitted events, and the URI in column 1, table 3 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.5).</p>
<p>d) The EventReason element shall be set as follows:</p>
<p>I. Code: field set to the appropriate URI of table 3 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.7 according to one of the reasons, summarized in the “URI code” cell of table C.28 for REM baseline, as prescribed in clauses C.4.5.1, C.4.5.2 and C.4.5.3.</p>
<p>II. first Details: field set to the appropriate “details code” value, from the second column of table C.28</p>
<p>III. second Details: field set to the appropriate “reason details” textual description of the event reason, got from the third column of table C.28.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1: <a class="reference external" href="tns:EventReasons">tns:EventReasons</a> <a class="reference external" href="tns:EventReason">tns:EventReason</a> <Code>http://uri.etsi.org/19522/EventReason/MessageAccepted</Code> <Details>RA01</Details> <Details>Message accepted</Details> &lt;/tns:EventReason&gt; &lt;/tns:EventReasons&gt;</p>
<p>e) Other possible Details components shall appear after the two canonical elements, as for the previous prescription. The EventTime element shall be set with the time raising the event (see instant time T0 in figure B.9, figure B.10, figure B.11 and figure B.12).</p>
<p>f) The EvidenceIssuerPolicyID element shall be set at least with the following URIs (see clause D.1.3):</p>
<p>I. http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1#/REMbaseline.</p>
<p>II. &lt;URI of the «en» International/English page of the REMID policy specified in CSISchemePolicyCommunityRules element of CapabilityAndSecurityInformation&gt; (e.g. https://CC-remid-authority.cc/remid-policy-en.html).</p>
<p>g) The EvidenceIssuerDetails element shall be set as follows, according to eIDAS TS SAML Attribute Profile [15], clauses 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 of which an excerpt is copied below for information:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="tns:EvidenceIssuerDetails">tns:EvidenceIssuerDetails</a> <a class="reference external" href="tns:Identity">tns:Identity</a> &lt;saml:Attribute FriendlyName=»LegalName» Name=»http://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/legalperson/LegalName» NameFormat=»urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri»&gt; &lt;saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi=»http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance» xsi:type=»elp:LegalNameType»&gt;»LEGAL NAME OF THE SERVICE PROVIDER» &lt;/saml:AttributeValue&gt; &lt;/saml:Attribute&gt; &lt;/tns:Identity&gt; &lt;/tns:EvidenceIssuerDetails&gt;</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p> The value «LEGAL NAME OF THE SERVICE PROVIDER» shall be set to the same value used in the ERDSGoverningBody ERDSMetadata element (see point c.3.3.2 of table C.8).</p>
<p> The other attribute values shall be set as per the excerpt above.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The namespace prefixes tns, saml, xsi, elp are not fixed and have the usual role in an XML.</p>
<p>h) The SenderDetails/Sender’s Identity attributes element shall be set as follows, according to eIDAS TS SAML Attribute Profile [15], clauses 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of which an excerpt is copied below for information (see also the best practices at statement 3) of the clause D.4.2):</p>
<p>I. I01: this component shall be used only for users belonging to qualified REMSP and according to the presence requirement summarized in table C.27 (and possibly, to further arrangements at REMID policy intended to reinforce its adoption during the issuing of the ERDS evidence).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="tns:Identity">tns:Identity</a> &lt;saml:Attribute FriendlyName=»PersonIdentifier» Name=»http://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/naturalperson/PersonIdentifier» NameFormat=»urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri»&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi=»http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchemainstance» xsi:type=»enp:PersonIdentifierType»&gt;»Source CC»/»Dest CC»/»userid» &lt;/saml:AttributeValue&gt; &lt;/saml:Attribute&gt; &lt;/tns:Identity&gt;</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p> The value «Source CC»/»Dest CC»/»userid» should be set as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>«Source CC»: the Country Code of the «user» (the sender in this case)</p></li>
<li><p>«Dest CC»: the Country Code of the REMSP (the pertinent EU MS of the sender’s REMSP     in this case)</p></li>
<li><p>«userid»: the sha256 digest (transformed in uppercase) of the user’s email (picked up in     lowercase)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EXAMPLE 2: ES/IT/466FA5C7D106870115F12BABFE65B7A3647E828B65BA0EBE5B5D38691DCC8F78</p>
<p>ES for a Spanish user IT for an Italian REMSP 466FA5C7D106870115F12BABFE65B7A3647E828B65BA0EBE5B5D38691DCC8F78 for the sender&#64;s-rems.rem email</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The other attribute values shall be set as per the excerpt above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 3: The namespace prefixes tns, saml, xsi, enp are not fixed and have the usual role in an XML.</p>
<p>NOTE 4: If the issuer of the ERDS evidence is the sender’s REMSP, it is, by definition, the entity to which the sender is «registered». Therefore, the sender’s REMSP has all the information to fill in the I01 component. And conversely, when the issuer of the ERDS evidence is the recipient’s REMSP, it has, as a starting point, the SubmissionAcceptance ERDS evidence attached to the REM dispatch which can be used as source information to fill in the I01 component.</p>
<p>II. I02: <Identifier IdentifierSchemeName="mailto">»sender’s email addr»</Identifier></p>
<p>i) The RecipientDetails/Recipient’s Identity attributes element shall be set as follows, according to eIDAS TS SAML Attribute Profile [15], clauses 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of which an excerpt is copied below for information (see also the best practices at statement 3) of the clause D.4.2):</p>
<p>I. I05: this component (one instance for each intended recipient) shall be used only for users belonging to qualified REMSP and according to the presence requirement summarized in table C.27 (and possibly, to further arrangements at REMID policy intended to reinforce its adoption during the issuing of the ERDS evidence).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="tns:Identity">tns:Identity</a> &lt;saml:Attribute FriendlyName=»PersonIdentifier» Name=»http://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/naturalperson/PersonIdentifier» NameFormat=»urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri»&gt; &lt;saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi=»http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchemainstance» xsi:type=»enp:PersonIdentifierType»&gt; «Source CC»/»Dest CC»/»userid» &lt;/saml:AttributeValue&gt; &lt;/saml:Attribute&gt; &lt;/tns:Identity&gt;</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The value «Source CC»/»Dest CC»/»userid» shall be set as follows:</p></li>
</ul>
<p> «Source CC»: the Country Code of the «user» (the recipient in this case)</p>
<p> «Dest CC»: the Country Code of the REMSP (the pertinent EU MS of the recipient’s REMSP in this case)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>«userid»: sha256 digest (transformed in uppercase) of the user’s email (picked up in lowercase).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EXAMPLE 3: DE/DE/3A7D68B6BD4C5CF1EB8D3F22E58679419AC5BBA466650035E73B2F54349F9868</p>
<p>DE for a German user DE for a German REMSP 3A7D68B6BD4C5CF1EB8D3F22E58679419AC5BBA466650035E73B2F54349F9868 for the recipient&#64;r-rems.rem email</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The other attribute values shall be set as per the excerpt above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 5: The namespace prefixes tns, saml, xsi, enp are not fixed and have the usual role in an XML.</p>
<p>NOTE 6: If the issuer of the ERDS evidence is the sender’s REMSP, it usually does not have the information to fill</p>
<p>in the I05 component (unless, for example, the case where S-REMS = R-REMS). Typically, such feature is not present except in instances where an ERDS evidence is issued after or as a consequence of another ERDS evidence coming from R-REMS (e.g. the issuing of a RelayFailure ERDS evidence as a result of a RelayRejection evidence): in such events, the triggering ERDS evidence, coming from R-REMS (and so having the I05 component, as explained below) can be used as source information to fill in the I05 component. And conversely, when the issuer of the ERDS evidence is the recipient’s REMSP, it is, by definition, the entity to which the recipient is «registered». Therefore, the recipient’s REMSP has all the information to fill in the I05 component.</p>
<p>II. I06: <Identifier IdentifierSchemeName="mailto">»recipient’s email addr»</Identifier></p>
<p>j) The SubmissionTime element shall be set with the time raising the initial delivery process (see instant time T0</p>

<p>k) The MessageIdentifier element shall be a UID generated according to IETF RFC 5322 [8], clause 3.6.4 (see also point a) above).</p>
<p>l) The UserContentInfo element shall be set as follows:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="tns:UserContentInfo">tns:UserContentInfo</a> <AppLayerIdentifier>»UA message-ID»</AppLayerIdentifier> <ComposingParts>1</ComposingParts> <a class="reference external" href="tns:PartsInfo">tns:PartsInfo</a> <a class="reference external" href="tns:PartInfo">tns:PartInfo</a> <Identifier>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.7</Identifier> <ContentType>message/rfc822</ContentType> &lt;ds:DigestMethod Algorithm=»URI of used algorithm»/&gt; <a class="reference external" href="ds:DigestValue">ds:DigestValue</a>»base64 val computed with the DigestMethod»&lt;/ds:DigestValue&gt; &lt;/tns:PartInfo&gt; &lt;/tns:PartsInfo&gt; &lt;/tns:UserContentInfo&gt;</p>
<p>Where, about the variable parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The value of the element «AppLayerIdentifier» shall be set to the original message’s Message-ID     header taking care of the necessary transcoding of the not admitted characters in the values of XML     elements (e.g. the “&lt;” and “&gt;” characters, systematically present in Message-ID headers, are translated in     “&lt; “ and “&gt;” entities)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 7: «AppLayerIdentifier» element value has the same value as the header MD14/REM</p>
<p>UAMessageIdentifier, apart from the XML transcoding not used in email headers.</p>

<p>DigestAlgorithm.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The value of the element PartInfo/DigestValue shall be set according to clause C.4.5.1 table C.22     point c)/V.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 9: «DigestValue» has the same value as the header MD14/REM-DigestValue.</p>
<p>NOTE 10: The namespace prefixes tns and ds are not fixed and have the usual role in an XML.</p>
<p>m) The Signature element shall include digital signature and time-stamp token as defined in clauses C.4.3 and C.4.4.</p>
<p>n) The Extension element shall be set according to clause C.3.2 table C.15 and table C.16.</p>
<p>o) The EvidenceRefersToRecipient element shall be set according to ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.21 (see clause C.4.5.3, table C.25 points a)II, h)I, h)II and i)II for specific usage of this element).</p>

<p><AssuranceLevelsDetails> <GlobalAssuranceLevel> <AssuranceLevel>»assurance level URI»</AssuranceLevel> <PolicyID>»assurance level policy URI»</PolicyID> </GlobalAssuranceLevel> <a class="reference external" href="tns:AuthenticationDetails">tns:AuthenticationDetails</a> <AuthenticationTime>»authentication time»</AuthenticationTime> <AuthenticationMethod>»authentication method URI»</AuthenticationMethod> &lt;/tns:AuthenticationDetails&gt; </AssuranceLevelsDetails></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The «AssuranceLevel» element value shall be set to the URI:     <a class="reference external" href="http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/substantial">http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/substantial</a></p></li>
<li><p>The «PolicyID» element value shall be set to a URI referencing the assurance levels definitions</p></li>
<li><p>The «AuthenticationTime» element value should be set as follows:</p></li>

<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The present phase starts with the «submission» event of the original message to the S-REMS (see time T0 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2). After the formal and security checks, the S-REMS has in charge of the application of the digital signature and time-stamp to the ERDS evidence for such event (composed as per clause C.3), and applying the digital signature to both REM dispatch and REM receipt. This process shall be executed as follows:</p>
<p>I. If any of the formal or security checks fail, the submission acceptance process shall be interrupted; and the flow continues from point h) with a SubmissionRejection</p>
<p>II. Otherwise, if all the checks of the previous step I. succeed, the flow shall continue with point b) assigning the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/SubmissionAcceptance to the ERDSEventId element of a SubmissionAcceptance ERDS evidence, and the EventReason/Code set to the URI http://uri.etsi.org/19522/EventReason/MessageAccepted.</p>
<p>b) The time reference T0 of the «submission» phase shall be set to the G05 EventTime element of the ERDS evidence according to the semantic of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 8.2.5 (see time T0 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2).</p>
<p>c) A «digest» of the entire «original message» shall be assigned to the digest child field of M02 (same as MD14) element of the ERDS evidence (see time T1 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2) in the context of the following process:</p>
<p>I. ComposingParts child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to 1</p>
<p>II. Identifier child field of element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «urn:oid:1.3.6.1.7» (that represents the identifier for iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) mail(7) OID, as defined in IANA SMI OID numbers).</p>
<p>III. ContentType child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «message/rfc822».</p>
<p>IV. DigestMethod child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to an algorithm, amongst those identified in the security policy as per the current best practice, in the form of a URI according to the element REM-DigestAlgorithm defined in ETSI EN 319 532-3 [6], table 2 (see also clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>V. DigestValue child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to the base64Binary encoded digest value of original message (candidate to be attached in the “Content-Type: message/rfc822; name=AttachedMimeMessage” MIME section of the REM dispatch) as computed using the digest algorithm indicated in the DigestMethod as mentioned earlier field. Such digest shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>i. normalization of the original message (e.g. some operation like the canonization of the Message-ID, etc. can be performed on the original message before its inclusion in the REM dispatch: the digest is computed after any change on it)</p>
<p>ii. binary digest, according to the attribute PartInfo/DigestMethod Algorithm (e.g. sha256) considering the original message as a “CRLF terminated” file (i.e. provided also with final 0x0D0A bytes at the end-of-file)</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Once the original message is attached inside the REM dispatch as rfc822 message media type MIME part,</p>
<p>two CRLFs/line breaks appear in the MIME stream at the end of such part: the first is composed by the 0x0D0A sequence representing the end-of-file of the original message, and the second CRLF is due to the requirement prescribed in IETF RFC 2046 [i.14], clause 5.1.1 (to have any boundary, and so also the epilogue of the original message, at the beginning of the line). The unambiguous individuation of the correct portion of the REM dispatch representing the original message (ending with the first CRLF) upon which re-compute the digest is fundamental during the check phases.</p>
<p>d) The XML structure of the ERDS evidence shall be filled with the necessary values (see time T2 in figure B.9</p>
<p>of clause B.3.2) as follows:</p>
<p>I. EvidenceIssuerPolicyID element of the ERDS evidence shall have a URI set to http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1#/REMbaseline and shall match the value of ERDSProfileSupported element of ERDSMetadata (see c.3.3.3 of table C.8 and clause D.1.3)</p>
<p>II. All the other contents and elements of ERDS evidence shall be set according to clause C.3</p>
<p>e) A standard XAdES-B-B baseline digital signature is applied to the XML evidence structure according to the</p>
<p>provisions of clause C.4.3 (see time T3 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2).</p>
<p>f) A standard time-stamp is generated and applied on top of the XAdES-B-B augmenting the signature level to</p>
<p>XAdES-B-T according to the provisions of clause C.4.4 (see time T4 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2). The ERDS evidence XML structure is ready to be «released» by the process of signature and time-stamp.</p>
<p>g) If there are no errors the ERDS evidence XML structure shall be attached to the REM dispatch built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2 (that can continue the flow with the relay event defined in clause C.4.5.2); and the same ERDS evidence XML structure shall be attached to a SubmissionAcceptance REM receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender (see time T5 in figure B.9 of clause B.3.2).</p>
<p>h) If one of the previous steps from a) to f) fails, the REM service shall issue the ERDS evidence, to attach to a SubmissionRejection REMS receipt, and send it back to the sender. This process shall be executed in the best-effort way, by the steps from b) to f) as follows:</p>
<p>I. if there are no errors in the execution of steps from b) to f), the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/SubmissionRejection shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of an ERDS evidence; and the ERDS evidence shall be attached to a SubmissionRejection REMS receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender, with the appropriate EventReason/Code about the formal or security checks failed (see the URIs of table 3 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.7 for the full list of codes).</p>
<p>II. if there is a permanent error during the execution of some step from b) to f), the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/SubmissionRejection shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of an ERDS evidence, and the process shall be completed in the best-effort way; and the ERDS evidence (even if not complete) shall be attached to a SubmissionRejection REMS receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender, with the appropriate EventReason/Code(s) regarding the failed step(s).</p>
<p>III. if there is some transient error on some step from b) to f), the process shall try to recover the error within a timeout fixed in the REMID policy (see clauses C.2.3.5 and D.1.3); if the error is back, the process shall continue with the step g); otherwise, in any case, the error is considered permanent, and the process shall continue as for the previous point II.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: In both cases I. and II. above, there can be additional rules in local REMID policy that dispose either one or both of particular preservations and practices on the REM dispatch in case of «security violations and threats» specified in the policy (see clause C.2.3.5). Anyway, none of these «additional» practices breaks the interoperability.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: In both cases, I. and II. above, there can be additional rules in local REMID policy that dispose of either one or both of particular preservations and practices on the REM dispatch in case of «security violations and threats» specified in the policy (see clause C.2.3.5). Anyway, this «additional» practice does not break the interoperability.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: ERDS/REMS standard does not prescribe the intra-provider relay operation in the case when R-REMS is</p>
<p>the same of S-REMS. So, the particular case of R-REMS = S-REMS and recipient(s) unknown or unregistered is not reported to the sender by an unsuccessful relay operation, since relay does not take place (indeed it is neither attempted), but through the ContentConsignmentFailure. This is also consistent with the RB10 «ERD message not relayed to the Recipient’s ERDSP for: Unknown Recipient» “reason details” semantic (according to ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 8.3.3.2 table 8). While, the case of R-REMS ≠ S-REMS and recipient(s) unknown or unregistered can be reported to the sender by a relay operation (RelayReject from R-REMS to S-REMS, and a RelayFailure from S-REMS to the sender), but with a specific code different from RB10 due to its semantic (since the relay takes place), as specified in the next statements.</p>
<p>i) The case of the recipient(s) unknown or unregistered to R-REMS is identified by an EventReason element specifically defined for REM baseline and implemented as follows:</p>
<p>I. the “URI code”/”reason details” identified by RB21 “details code” shall apply (see table C.28 and the example at point d) of clause C.3.4 for the disposition of EventReason relevant elements);</p>
<p>II. the RelayEvidenceRefersTo ERDS evidence element of RelayReject shall be used to reference, with the specific positional integer(s), the recipient(s) whose the relay evidence refers to, among all the intended recipients, according to the point a) of clause C.3.2.2, table C.16.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The cardinality of recipients referred to by any relay ERDS evidence is multiple: RelayReject/RelayFailure identify, as suitable, one or more unknown recipients by RelayEvidenceRefersTo element.</p>
<p>NOTE 4: The RelayAcceptance ERDS evidence corresponding to the present transaction references, by RelayEvidenceRefersTo, the counterpart of all the intended recipients (i.e. the complement of that referenced in RelayReject ERDS evidence).</p>

<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The present phase starts with the «REM dispatch», relayed by S-REMS to R-REMS, that is in «failing» status event, for some reason (see time T0 in figure B.11 of clause B.3.3). The responsibility to inform the sender remains to the S-REMS that has in charge of the application of the digital signature and time-stamp to the ERDS evidence for such failing event (composed as per clause C.3), and the application of the digital signature to the REM receipt. This process shall be executed as follows:</p>

The value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/RelayFailure shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of a RelayFailure ERDS evidence, the EventReason/Code set to the appropriate URI according to the failure reason (see the URIs of table 3 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.7 for the full list of codes) and the Extensions/RelayEvidenceRefersTo element set to the recipient(s) that the evidence refers to, among all, the intended recipients.</p>
<p>II. If the S-REMS receive a RelayRejection REM receipts from R-REMS, a proper error code is set for the evidence (according to ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], table 3) and the flow continues from point h) with a RelayFailure ERDS evidence.</p>
<p>III. If the S-REMS was unable to relay the REM dispatch to R-REMS within a given time period specified in the REMID policy, a proper error code is set for the evidence (according to ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], table 3) and the flow continues from point h) with a RelayFailure ERDS evidence.</p>
<p>IV. If the S-REMS was unable to receive a RelayAcceptance REM receipts, relevant to the aforementioned REM dispatch, within a given time period specified in the REMID policy, a proper error code is set for the evidence (according to ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], table 3) and the flow continues from point h) with a RelayFailure ERDS evidence.</p>
<p>b) The time reference T0 of the «failing» event (relay rejection or unable to relay) shall be set to the G05 EventTime element of the ERDS evidence according to the semantic of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 8.2.5 (see time T0 in figure B.11 of clause B.3.3).</p>
<p>c) The «digest» of the «original message» contained in M02 ERDS evidence element of REM dispatch (or of RelayRejection REM receipt) shall be assigned, by copy, to the digest child field of M02 (same as MD14) element of RelayFailure ERDS evidence (see time T1 in figure B.11 of clause B.3.3) in the context of the following process:</p>
<p>I. ComposingParts child field of UserContentInfo element shall be set to 1.</p>
<p>II. Identifier child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «urn:oid:1.3.6.1.7» (that represents the identifier for iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) mail(7) OID, as defined in IANA SMI OID numbers).</p>
<p>III. ContentType child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «message/rfc822».</p>

DigestValue child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to as a «copy» of the base64 encoded digest value of original message taken from ERDS evidence attached in REM dispatch (that has been computed using the digest algorithm indicated in the aforementioned DigestMethod field).</p>
<p>d) The XML structure of the ERDS evidence shall be filled with the necessary values (see time T2 in figure B.11</p>
<p>of clause B.3.3) as follows:</p>
<p>I. EvidenceIssuerPolicyID element of the ERDS evidence shall have a URI set to http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1#/REMbaseline and shall match the value of ERDSProfileSupported element of ERDSMetadata (see c.3.3.3 of table C.8 and clause D.1.3).</p>

<p>f) A standard time-stamp is generated and applied on top of the XAdES-B-B, augmenting the signature level to</p>
<p>XAdES-B-T according to the provisions of clause C.4.4 (see time T4 in figure B.11 of clause B.3.3); and the ERDS evidence XML structure is ready to be «released» by the process of signature and time-stamp.</p>
<p>g) If there are no errors, the ERDS evidence XML structure shall be attached to a RelayFailure REM receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender (see time T5 in figure B.11 of clause B.3.3); and the flows for the entire REM transaction stops here.</p>
<p>h) If one of the previous steps from a) to f) fails, the REM service shall issue the ERDS evidence, to attach to a</p>
<p>RelayFailure REMS receipt and send it back to the sender. This process shall be executed in the best-effort way, by the steps from b) to f) as follows:</p>
<p>I. If there are no errors in the execution of steps from b) to f), the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/RelayFailure shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of an ERDS evidence and the Extensions/RelayEvidenceRefersTo element set to the recipient(s) that the evidence refers to, among all, the intended recipients; and the ERDS evidence shall be attached to a RelayFailure REMS receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender, with the appropriate EventReason/Code about the formal or security checks failed, and the flows for the transaction stops here.</p>
<p>II. If either there is a permanent error during the execution of some step from b) to f) or the process achieved a pre-determined number of cycles, the event is logged as a permanent error to be properly managed by S-REMS according to the local REMID policy; and the flows for the transaction stops here.</p>
<p>III. If there is some transient error on some step from b) to f), the process shall try to recover the error within a timeout fixed in the REMID policy (see clause C.2.3.5); if the error is back, the process shall continue with the step g); otherwise, in any case, the error is considered permanent, and the process shall continue as for the previous point II.</p>
<p>NOTE 5: In both cases I. and II. above, there can be additional rules in local REMID policy that dispose of either</p>
<p>one or both of particular preservations and practices on the REM dispatch in case of «security violations and threats» specified in the policy (see clause C.2.3.5). Anyway, this «additional» practice does not break the interoperability.</p>
<p>NOTE 6: With the same consideration as per note 2 and note 3 above, the case of R-REMS ≠ S-REMS and</p>
<p>recipient(s) unknown or unregistered can be reported to the sender by a relay operation (RelayReject from R-REMS to S-REMS, and a RelayFailure from S-REMS to the sender), as specified in the next statements.</p>
<p>i) The case of the recipient(s) unknown or unregistered to R-REMS is identified by an EventReason element</p>
<p>specifically defined for REM baseline and implemented as follows:</p>
<p>I. The “URI code”/”reason details” identified by RB21 “details code” shall apply (see table C.28 and the example at point d) of clause C.3.4 for the disposition of EventReason relevant elements).</p>
<p>II. The RelayEvidenceRefersTo ERDS evidence element of RelayFailure shall be used to reference, with the specific positional integer(s), the recipient(s) whose the relay evidence refers to, among all the intended recipients, according to the point a) of clause C.3.2.2, table C.16; the RelayAcceptance ERDS evidence corresponding to the present transaction references, by RelayEvidenceRefersTo, the counterpart of all the intended recipients (i.e. the complement of that referenced in RelayFailure ERDS evidence).</p>

<p>Clause 6.2.4 D.2. M a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i)</p>
<p>ConsignmentFailure event</p>
<p>Implementation guidance:</p>
<p>a) The present phase consists of the «consignment» event of the «REM dispatch», relayed by S-REMS, to the recipient (see time T0 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4). After the formal and security checks (if any), the RREMS has in charge of the application of the digital signature and time-stamp to the ERDS evidence for such event (composed as per clause C.3), and the application of the digital signature to the REM receipt. This process shall be executed as follows:</p>
<p>I. If any of the formal or security checks fail the content consignment process shall be interrupted; and the flow continues from point h) with a ContentConsignmentFailure.</p>
<p>II. Otherwise, if all the checks of the previous step I. succeed, the flow shall continue with point b) assigning the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/ContentConsignment to the ERDSEventId element of a ContentConsignment ERDS evidence. The EventReason/Code set to the URI http://uri.etsi.org/19522/EventReason/MessageConsignedToRecipient and the EvidenceRefersToRecipient element set to the recipient that the evidence refers to among all the intended recipients.</p>
<p>b) The time reference T0 of the «consignment» phase shall be set to the G05 EventTime element of the ERDS evidence according to the semantic of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 8.2.5 (see time T0 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4).</p>
<p>c) The «digest» of the «original message» contained in M02 ERDS evidence element of REM dispatch shall be assigned, by copy, to the digest child field of M02 (same as MD14) element of the ERDS evidence (see time T1 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4) in the context of the following process:</p>
<p>I. ComposingParts child field of UserContentInfo element shall be set to 1.</p>
<p>II. Identifier child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «urn:oid:1.3.6.1.7» (that represents the identifier for iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) mail(7) OID, as defined in IANA SMI OID numbers).</p>
<p>III. ContentType child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to «message/rfc822».</p>
<p>IV. DigestMethod child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set as a «copy» of the digest method taken from DigestMethod child field of an element of the ERDS evidence attached in REM dispatch.</p>
<p>V. DigestValue child field of an element of UserContentInfo shall be set to as a «copy» of the base64 encoded digest value of original message taken from ERDS evidence attached in REM dispatch (that has been computed using the digest algorithm indicated in the aforementioned DigestMethod field).</p>
<p>d) The XML structure of the ERDS evidence shall be filled with the necessary values (see time T2 in figure B.12</p>
<p>of clause B.3.4) as follows:</p>
<p>I. EvidenceIssuerPolicyID element of the ERDS evidence shall have a URI set to http://uri.etsi.org/19532/v1#/REMbaseline and shall match the value of ERDSProfileSupported element of ERDSMetadata (see c.3.3.3 of table C.8 and clause D.1.3).</p>
<p>II. All the other contents and elements of ERDS evidence shall be set according to clause C.3.</p>
<p>e) A standard XAdES-B-B baseline digital signature is applied to the XML evidence structure according to the</p>
<p>provisions of clause C.4.3 (see time T3 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4).</p>
<p>f) A standard time-stamp is generated and applied on top of the XAdES-B-B, augmenting the signature level to</p>
<p>XAdES-B-T according to the provisions of clause C.4.4 (see time T4 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4); and the ERDS evidence XML structure is ready to be «released» by the process of signature and time-stamp.</p>
<p>g) If there are no errors, the ERDS evidence XML structure shall be attached to a ContentConsignment REM receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender (see time T5 in figure B.12 of clause B.3.4); and the REM dispatch is consigned to the user mailbox.</p>
<p>h) If one of the previous steps from a) to f) fails, the REM service shall issue the ERDS evidence to attach to a</p>
<p>ContentConsignmentFailure REMS receipt and send it back to the sender. This process shall be executed in the best-effort way, by the steps from b) to f) as follows:</p>
<p>I. If there are no errors in the execution of steps from b) to f), the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/ContentConsignmentFailure shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of an ERDS evidence and the EvidenceRefersToRecipient element set to the recipient that the evidence refers to among all the intended recipients; and the ERDS evidence shall be attached to a ContentConsignmentFailure REMS receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender, with the appropriate EventReason/Code about the formal or security checks failed (see the URIs of table 3 of ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.7 for the full list of codes).</p>
<p>II. If there is a permanent error during the execution of some step from b) to f), the value http://uri.etsi.org/19522/Event/ContentConsignmentFailure shall be set to the ERDSEventId element of an ERDS evidence, the EvidenceRefersToRecipient element set to the recipient that the evidence refers to among all the intended recipients and the process shall be completed in the best-effort way; and the ERDS evidence (even if not complete) shall be attached to a ContentConsignmentFailure REMS receipt, built according to clauses 5.4 and C.4.2, to be sent back to the sender, with the appropriate EventReason/Code(s) regarding the failed step(s).</p>
<p>III. If there is some transient error on some step from b) to f), the process shall try to recover the error within a timeout fixed in the REMID policy (see clause C.2.3.5); if the error is back, the process shall continue with the step g); otherwise, in any case, the error is considered permanent, and the process shall continue as for the previous point II.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: In both cases I. and II. above, there can be additional rules in local REMID policy that dispose of either</p>
<p>one or both of particular preservations and practices on the REM dispatch in case of «security violations and threats» specified in the policy (see clause C.2.3.5). Anyway, this «additional» practice does not break the interoperability.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The particular case of R-REMS = S-REMS and recipient(s) unknown or unregistered is reported to the sender by ContentConsignmentFailure(s), as covered by the next statements.</p>
<p>i) The case of the recipient(s) unknown or unregistered to R-REMS is identified by an EventReason element</p>
<p>specifically defined for REM baseline and implemented as follows:</p>
<p>I. The “URI code”/”reason details” identified by the RD21 “details code” shall apply (see table C.28 and the example at point d) of clause C.3.4 for the disposition of EventReason relevant elements).</p>
<p>II. The I09 EvidenceRefersToRecipient ERDS evidence element of ContentConsignmentFailure shall be used to reference, with the specific positional integer, the recipient whose the consignment evidence refers to, among all the intended recipients, according to the point o) of clause C.3.4, table C.18.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The cardinality of recipients referred to by any content consignment ERDS evidence is one: ContentConsignmentFailure identifies exactly one unknown recipient by the I09 EvidenceRefersToRecipient element.</p>

<p>With regards to the application of digital signatures and time-stamp to ERDS evidence and digital signatures to REM messages, the events and constraints of clauses C.4.5.1, C.4.5.2 and C.4.5.3 shall apply to REM baseline according to</p>
<p>the provisions of the present clause (see ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], clause 6.1, clause 8.3 and clause 8.4 for the full description; and ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clause 5.2.2.7 for the full list of codes).</p>
<p>Table C.26 and table C.27 within this clause define cardinality requirements and notes that apply, respectively, to the different REM message headers and ERDS evidence components.</p>
<p>Below follows a detailed explanation of the content of the aforementioned tables:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The first row contains the set of REM message types (in the case of table C.26) and the set of events on which an evidence may be issued (in the case of table C.27).</p></li>
<li><p>The first column contains the set of REM message headers (in the case of table C.26) and the set evidence components (in the case of table C.27) prescribed for REM baseline.</p></li>
<li><p>Each cell within table C.26 and table C.27 contains the cardinality requirements that apply to the header or the component identified by the row, in correspondence of the REM message or of the event identified by the column respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>The cardinality requirements are expressed in the following form:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0: The REM message (table C.26) or evidence (table C.27) associated with the event identified by the     column shall not incorporate any header or component identified by the row, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>1: The REM message (table C.26) or evidence (table C.27) associated with the event identified by the     column shall incorporate exactly one instance of the header or component identified by the row,     respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>0..1: The REM message (table C.26) or evidence (table C.27) associated with the event identified by the     column shall incorporate zero or one instance of the header or component identified by the row,     respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>*: The REM message (table C.26) or evidence (table C.27) associated with the event identified by the     column shall incorporate zero or more instances of the header or component identified by the row,     respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>1..*: The REM message (table C.26) or evidence (table C.27) associated with the event identified by the     column shall incorporate one or more instances of the header or component identified by the row,     respectively.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the cardinality, some cells identify an explanatory note on their contents using letters enclosed in round brackets. Notes appear after the tables.</p>
<p>NOTE: There can be additional rules in local REMID policy that further tune the ranges of cardinalities of the following tables for either one or both of particular practices and behaviours specified in the policy (see clause C.2.3.5).

(b) If this element is absent, the ERDS shall be considered related to all the intended recipients.</p>
<p>Regarding the M04 ExternalSystem element, it is specified, inside XSD as ForwardedToExternalSystem (that, as name</p>
<p>to use, takes precedence as per ETSI EN 319 522-3 [3], clauses 4.1 and 5.1). It is used in mixed situations where NonERDS users are involved as either one or both sender and recipients together a pure REM baseline interchange. So,</p>
<p>inside ERDS Evidence, its usage is relevant to such NonERDS users. In the case of ReceivedFromNonERDS, RelayToNonERDS and RelayToNonERDSFailure events (the first two associated with specific REM dispatches</p>
<p>from/to external systems, and the last associated with a REM receipt), the ForwardedToExternalSystem element should be present in the relevant ERDS evidence XML structures, and should be set as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>REM dispatch/ReceivedFromNonERDS ERDS evidence: ForwardedToExternalSystem set to the «Received»     header of the original message, received from an external system, containing information on it.</p></li>
<li><p>REM dispatch/RelayToNonERDS ERDS evidence: ForwardedToExternalSystem set to the MX-record of the     NonERDS remote system where the REM dispatch is relayed.</p></li>
<li><p>REM receipt/RelayToNonERDSFailure ERDS evidence: ForwardedToExternalSystem set to the MX-record     of the NonERDS remote system where the REM dispatch was tried to relay to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Table C.28 summarizes the matching among codes, URIs and details identifying reasons causing events occurrences.</p>
<p>Moreover, three new codes (RB21, RB22 and RD21) specific for REM baseline are defined (as suggested and granted by rows identified with code RBXX and RDXX of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [2], table 8 and table 10, respectively).</p>
<p>Below follows a detailed explanation of the content of table C.28.</p>
<p>The first row contains a short description of each column:</p>

<p>The implementation guidance b) of clause C.2.3.5 illustrates a method for the publication. Such practice is derived from clauses 5.3.9 and D.4 of ETSI TS 119 612 [12], where other details are defined.</p>
<p>The collection of elements present in the REMID policy regards service and security aspects and technical conditions that need to be specialized at the local level, without breaking the interoperability.

<p>The REMID policy represents a place where define specific elements characterizing the certificates for all the digital</p>
<p>signatures of REM messages and ERDS evidence XML structures and also certificates for TLS CSI used for the REMID level. Such elements include, for example, Certificate Name Check Conventions on SubjectAltName (SAN)</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">4.31.2.2. </span>D.2.2.2 Certificate issuing path<a class="headerlink" href="#d-2-2-2-certificate-issuing-path" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The adoption of the following properties, involving the digital certificate signing REM messages, improves the user</p>
<p>experience and facilitates the installation/configuration of REM systems:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Issued in the path of a top-level Root CA worldwide recognized by any Operating System and client browser:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Signatures using certificates issued in the path of a top-level Root CA certificate, trusted by the common operating systems (and the relevant browsers through their own Root CA cache), are ideal for facilitating automatic verification in any user client (browser or application). Using this property, the usual email client retrieving and verifying incoming messages from REMS will not receive any warning. It would be unpleasant that, for a «qualified» service, a REMS’s recipient receives an invalid signature warning each time a REM message is retrieved from a REMS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all the key-stores of the software applications implementing REMS contain, basically, all the top-level Root CA world-wide recognized by any Operating System or client browsers (and these key-stores are automatically updated contextually with the system updates). This property facilitates the setup and management of REM systems. In fact, in such a case, the digital signature’s basic validation takes place without exceptions/software or execution interruptions. Vice versa, when the root CA are not in the key-store, either one or both of the software and the digital signature libraries could not work properly. In such a case, it would be necessary to update, as some new REMSP enters the circuit continuously, and with custom procedures, all the involved servers key-stores with the required custom Root CA. This greatly complicates the management of the systems and their reliability.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Used as «digital identity of REMS»: In fact, as illustrated in the rationales of table B.4, the digital certificate signing REM messages and ERDS evidence is used as digital identity of the relevant REMSP.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the aforementioned digital certificate on ServiceDigitalIdentity element of TL: As illustrated in the definitions of table C.4, the digital certificate signing REM messages and ERDS evidence is represented from the ServiceDigitalIdentity element of TL.</p></li>
<li><p>Placement on the following certification path is:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>top-level Root CA (recognized by OS and browsers)</p></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>subordinate CA (with required/restricted purposes mentioned in statement 1 of table B.4)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li><p>REMS digital identity certificate (for message/evidence signature)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The certification path illustrated above is obtained by putting together the aforementioned properties, and only the third certificate will be in TL.</p>
<p>In other words, for the digital signature of REM messages, the classical S/MIME digital certificates, further ensured in TL, represent the ideal solution for both practicality and usability.</p>
<p>A slightly different situation occurs for the digital signature of ERDS evidence XML structures. There is no typical direct usage, of these XML objects, by the final users, using standard clients (in comparison to the REM messages that</p>
<p>are directly used by normal email clients, and thus unrecognized certificates produce confounding warnings). But, as seen in the rationales of table B.4, the need to ensure this certificate in TL and the constraint to have only one</p>
<p>public-key per service digital identity certificate leads to use the same digital certificate for the signature of both ERDS evidence XML structures and REM messages.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the digital signature of CapabilityAndSecurityInformation XML structure, the point c.3.1.12 of table C.6 and the same considerations done above for ERDS evidence leads to use, also for this digital signature, the</p>
<p>aforementioned digital certificate.</p>
<p>Finally, the digital certificate for Transport Layer Security (TLS) is ensured in TL by reference, using the</p>
<p>CapabilityAndSecurityInformation XML structure. So there is no special direction about the certificate issuing path of such certificate except what is laid down on the specific REMID policy for local requirements.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.33.2. </span>D.4.2 Basic handshake<a class="headerlink" href="#d-4-2-basic-handshake" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main run-time pre-relay operations implemented by S-REMS foresee to perform the checks on trust and capabilities equivalence before the relay of a REM message to the R-REMS (see rationales of table B.2 and table B.7,</p>
<p>and relevant prescriptions in clause C.2.3.3.3, clause C.2.3.4.1 point c.3.1.1 and c.3.1.3 of table C.6, clause C.2.3.4.3 table C.9 and clause C.2.3.4.5 table C.12).</p>
<p>Other practices involve:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Version of any trusting/interoperability elements and protocols (e.g. TL, ERDSMetadata, TLS, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Countries of source/destination detection, when required by REMID policy to compile the identity components (see points h) and i) of table C.18).</p></li>
<li><p>As stated in eIDAS TS SAML Attribute Profile [15], clause 2.2.3 the «userid» element is composed of any string of readable characters uniquely identifying the identity asserted in the origin country. The REMID policy fixes a solution for the «CC/CC/userid» element of the identity component according to the points h) and i) of clause C.3.4, table C.18.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>EXAMPLE: The use of a well-known function, stated at REMID policy level, (e.g. SHA-256 hash) of the user’s email address as «userid» element ensures the unicity of the «userid» to use for both I01 SenderDetails/Sender’s Identity attributes and I05 RecipientDetails/Recipient’s Identity attributes elements.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.11.1. </span>4.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>An ERDS provides evidence about events that happen during the transfer of data between parties (e.g. evidence that the data has been delivered to the recipient), similar to well-known physical postal services for paper-based documents, such as «registered mail» and/or «return receipt». This evidence can be used to prove to third parties, if needed also in legal proceedings, that the transaction took place at the time and between the parties as indicated in the evidence. The legal requirements to an ERDS and the evidence it needs to support can vary across different domains.</p>
<p>An ERDS evidence is an attestation provided by an ERDS that a specific event related to the process of transferring some specific data between the sender and recipient (for instance, the submission of a message, the delivery of a message, the refusal of a message) happened at a certain time. An ERDS evidence can be immediately delivered to the sender/recipient or can be kept in a repository for later access by interested parties. It is common practice to implement ERDS evidence as digitally signed data. The concept of ERDS evidence can be assimilated to nonrepudiation tokens defined in ISO/IEC 13888 [i.2], [i.3] and [i.4], with many specificities as illustrated in clause 6. Secure and reliable delivery to a recipient requires that the recipient is uniquely identified. The present document also covers the unique identification of the sender (which is a requirement, for instance, for enforcing legal accountability), even if in some cases his identity is not disclosed to the recipient. Unique identification can be achieved by one unique identifier or by a collection of attributes that together uniquely identify the actor. An important purpose of the present document is to support ERDS delivery between senders and recipients that are natural or legal persons; however, in principle any uniquely identified entity (system, service, function, etc.) that can be addressed through an ERDS can be a sender or recipient. The present document also addresses delegation, i.e. the capability of a sender or a recipient to delegate a different entity to act on their behalf. An ERDS can rely on external, trusted parties for authentication.</p>
<p>The ERDS concept described above can be implemented in diverse ways, using different formats for identifiers and ERDS evidence, using different protocols for messaging, and even different message delivery models. Clause 4 aims to provide a general model that includes all relevant features, while abstracting from implementation issues. For convenience, the modelling goes through three steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A black-box model, dealing with a single ERDS. Internal complexities of the ERDS are not relevant as far as it     can be seen as a unique system under the responsibility of a single ERDSP. The black-box model describes the     interactions of the ERDS with the sender and recipients through an application layer outside of the boundary     of the ERDS.</p></li>
<li><p>A 4-corner model, dealing with the exchange of data and ERDS evidence between two ERDSs: one on the     sender’s side, the other on the recipient’s side. The interaction of the ERDSs with the sender and recipient     (interfaces) are the same as in the black-box model.</p></li>
<li><p>An extended model, dealing with the transmission of data and ERDS evidence through a chain of ERDSs.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="black-box-model">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.11.2. </span>4.2 Black-box model<a class="headerlink" href="#black-box-model" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<section id="functional-viewpoint">
<h4><span class="section-number">5.11.2.1. </span>4.2.1 Functional viewpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-viewpoint" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the simplest case, an ERDS can be represented as a black box, conveying messages between a sender and a recipient and producing the appropriate ERDS evidence. Figure 1 provides a simple representation.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Black-box registered delivery service model</p>
<p>ERDS can be accessed by an ERD-UA, i.e. an application directly interacting with a human user or an enterprise application (an ERP, a document workflow, etc.) with or without involvement of a human user. ERDS allows to submit/receive user content plus associated metadata and to receive ERDS evidence related to the delivery process. The sender provides unique identification of the recipient, and the ERDS associates it to the correct delivery endpoint.</p>
<p>Between applications, an application layer protocol (e.g. a business process protocol) is executed, consisting of a sequence of one or more messages in one or both directions. Applications can belong to service providers within particular (business) areas (e.g. an e-procurement service provider or an e-health service provider). An application layer protocol can include requirements and mechanisms for application of digital signatures to message content before sending, for end-to-end encryption between sender and recipient, etc. The application protocol is out of scope of the ERDS, which needs not to possess knowledge of the application layer logic nor the relationships between different messages. From the ERDS point of view, the application-level service providers will act in this case as a sender/recipient. The ERD-UA will submit the user content, together with additional metadata (receiver identification, etc.) to the ERDS.</p>
<p>Breaking into the black box, figure 1 introduces some components which are typically included in an ERDS, namely:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ERDS Message delivery system: this component grants that the user content submitted by the sender is made     available to the intended recipient. Note that this does not necessarily imply a transfer of the data (e.g. the     delivery can consist in making existing data available to the recipient).</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS User directory: this component is used to translate the unique identification of a recipient, possibly     augmented by further metadata, into a delivery endpoint. The same recipient can correspond to more delivery     endpoints, depending on metadata (e.g. user content and evidence, or even different types of user content, can     be directed to different endpoints).</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS Evidence provider: this component produces the ERDS evidence upon completion of specific delivery     events.</p></li>
<li><p>ERDS Evidence repository: this component grants the persistence of ERDS evidence for a period of time     which depends on the specific policies of the service. Storing of the ERDS evidence can be performed by a     third party service, outside the ERDS.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="section-number">5.11.2.2. </span>4.2.2 Sequence viewpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#sequence-viewpoint" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the black-box perspective, the typical electronic registered delivery flow appears as presented in figure 2. Clause 6.2 provides a precise definition of «handover» and «consignment».</p>
<p>Figure 2: Black-box registered delivery basic flow</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The sender is authenticated to the electronic registered delivery service. As mentioned above, identification     and authentication can also be implemented through a trusted third party or identity federation (e.g. using     OpenID Connect or SAML).</p></li>
<li><p>The sender’s ERD-UA prepares the original message consisting of the user content, one or more recipients, and     optionally some options on the requested registered delivery service (e.g. confidential, urgent, etc.), and     submits it to the electronic registered delivery service. This step can in some case merge with step 1 (e.g. if the     message is packaged together with an authentication token).</p></li>
<li><p>The electronic registered delivery service tracks the event that the original message has been submitted. This is     done producing ERDS evidence («attestation of submission»), which can take many forms as long as an     attestation of the event can be extracted from the system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes the ERDS evidence is sent back to the sender. This behaviour can be defined by a policy, or depends on a delivery option indicated by the sender. Independently from sending to the sender, the ERDS evidence can be stored for a certain amount of time by the system as specified in the service policy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Optionally, a notification to the recipient (possibly on a separate channel) about the to-be-consigned user     content can be sent, in a service-specific way that ensures confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, the recipient’s ERD-UA interacts with the ERDS to accept the consignment of the user content.     Alternatively, the recipient does not accept the consignment by not reacting or by explicit refusal. If the     recipient rejects the user content, then the delivery process is aborted and the corresponding event is tracked by     the service, otherwise the service tracks the notification event, and the delivery process is continued.</p></li>
<li><p>The consignment to the recipient(s) happens, meaning that the user content submitted by the sender is made     available to the recipient(s) ERD-UA within the boundaries of the ERDS system, in a way that depends on the     specific service implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>The electronic registered delivery service tracks the event that the user content has been made available to the     recipient(s). Again, this is often done producing ERDS evidence («attestation of consignment completed»).     The attestation can be sent back to the sender. This behaviour can be defined by a policy, or depends on a     delivery option indicated by the sender. Independently from sending to the sender, the attestation can also be     stored for a certain amount of time by the system as specified in the service policy.</p></li>
<li><p>The recipient is authenticated to the ERDS.</p></li>
<li><p>The user content is handed over to the recipient’s ERD-UA, meaning that the user content crosses the     boundaries of the ERDS and reaches recipient’s ERD-UA, in a service-specific way that ensures     confidentiality. An ERDS evidence related to handover can be produced. Handover can also happen prior to     consignment, or even in the absence of a consignment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, the flow ignores negative cases (failure in delivery, etc.) and different modes for handing over the user content to the recipient (e.g. push/pull, with evidence attached to the user content or separated from it), as well as other relevant events which can be tracked by the system. Only the core events «submission» and «consignment» have been explicitly tracked in figure 2.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">5.11.3.1. </span>4.3.1 Functional viewpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In many practical cases the sender and the recipient are subscribed to different ERDSs. In that case, when the sender’s ERDS does not have the capability to directly deliver the user content to the recipient, it can have the option to relay to a different ERDS which has this capability. This gives rise to a new scenario, which is presented in figure 3.</p>
<p>Figure 3: 4-Corner electronic registered delivery service model</p>
<p>In this scenario, the sender’s ERDS can inform the sender about the consignment only when the recipient’s ERDS has completed its job and has notified the completion to the sender’s ERDS. This is rendered in figure 3 by the backward direction of the «ERDS message relay» arrow, which is a notification of the completed tasks. The arrow represents only a logical transfer, since ERDS evidence is not necessarily pushed back as separate messages, as far as it is available to the sender’s ERDS.</p>
<p>This scenario implies some shared background to work. Contractual agreements will usually be needed, either directly between the ERDSPs or by the ERDSPs entering an agreement that includes them in some kind of community. Service can be provided based on common static configurations, or can require a shared technological infrastructure.</p>
<p>Functions provided by the shared technological infrastructure can include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Message routing: the sender’s ERDS needs to know which ERDS (or ERDSs) can deliver to the recipient. In     some cases, this information is embedded in the recipient’s electronic identifier (e.g. in e-mail messaging,     john.doe&#64;acme.com already contains routing information). In the general case, the association of the     recipient’s electronic identifier to the recipient’s ERDS may depend on other metadata and be supported by a     shared infrastructure. The infrastructure can consist of a centralized directory, a distributed ledger, DNS     entries, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust establishment: to entrust the message to its counterpart, the sender’s ERDS needs to rest assured that it     will properly manage it. A trust relation with the recipient’s ERDS will also enable the sender’s ERDS to     provide ERDS evidence about the delivery of the message, on which it has no control. Similarly, the recipient’s     ERDS needs to trust the sender’s ERDS for producing ERDS evidence about the provenance of the message.</p></li>
<li><p>Capability management: the sender’s ERDS needs to know whether the recipient’s ERDS has the technical     capabilities for interactions: it implements a common transport protocol, it deals with the required ERDS     evidence, it provides user authentication at the appropriate level, etc. In closed environments, these issues are     normally solved by prior off-line information sharing, while in open environments, ERDSs can dynamically     expose the information (e.g. via a WSDL, Service Metadata Publishing), possibly on a shared infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Governance support: some general governance functions can be in place to deal with incident management,     Service Level Agreement monitoring, configuration management, accounting, liability management and     similar governance functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a multi-ERDS delivery scenario, some components which are normally implemented by an ERDS (dotted boxes in figure 3) can be moved to the shared infrastructure, like for instance: shared user directory and a shared ERDS evidence directory. Functions provided by the shared infrastructure need not necessarily be provided by a distinct central service; they can be individually provided by the same ERDSs (for instance in the case of capability functions) or by a distributed infrastructure whose nodes are run by the same ERDSPs providing the ERDS services.</p>

<p>While the user experience is the same as for the black-box model, the reality behind a 4-corner electronic registered delivery service is more complex due to the number of actors involved, operated by different providers. In this case the typical sequence diagram appears as follows in figure 4.</p>
<p>Figure 4: 4-Corner electronic registered delivery basic flow</p>
<p>Contrary to figure 3, for a simplified reading, the production of attestations has been removed from the figure, as well as negative cases (failure, non-acceptance) and other events. It is however assumed that any significant event has an associated attestation.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>and 2. Message submission, as in steps 1 and 2 of the black-box model.</p></li>
<li><p>Sender’s ERDS (S-ERDS) needs to determine the recipient’s ERDS (R-ERDS). In the general case, this     happens through a common infrastructure (Common). This is an abstract entity, which can correspond to     several distinct actors. S-ERDS needs to:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Determine R-ERDS: this can involve lookup to a centralized or distributed registry (e.g. DNS).</p></li>
<li><p>Establish trustworthiness of R-ERDS, possibly checking against a trust information provider such as a     Trust Status List (in a restricted network, peer-to-peer agreements can be established with no central trust     information provider). Since trust networks are normally stable over long time periods and do not change     frequently, the process does not necessarily involve an on-line transaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Handshake with R-ERDS. This can include negotiation on different aspects (supported formats, protocols,     ERDS evidence, strength of authentication of end entities, fees, etc.). Handshake can be omitted in closed     systems where this information is defined a priori or available through a centralized infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>The message is relayed to the R-ERDS (in case of more recipients, the message is dispatched to the respective     R- ERDS). S-ERDS can add some meta-information to the message.</p></li>
<li><p>The R-ERDS can check, on its turn, trustworthiness of S-ERDS via Common. This step happens before the     message relay, or even at a different time unrelated to the message delivery flow (e.g. once a day), according     to the service policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>7., 8., 9., 11. and 12. Consignment and handover to the recipient’s ERD-UA, as in the respective steps of the blackbox model.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li><p>and 13. The R-ERDS needs to inform S-ERDS about the successful consignment and handover of the user     content to the recipient. Since the information comes from a trusted party, S-ERDS has the necessary elements     to attest the consignment and handover to the recipient. The diagram hints at evidence flowing back to the S-     ERDS for illustration purposes. As better specified in clause 6, the requirement is that evidence is produced     and made available to S-ERDS.</p></li>

<p>In a more general scenario, the delivery process can go through several chained ERDSs, as presented in figure 5.</p>
<p>Figure 5: Extended electronic registered delivery service model</p>
<p>The scenario extends the previous one. The sender’s ERDS informs the sender about the outcome of the delivery process on the base of the trusted information it gets (either directly, through a repository, or mediated by intermediate ERDSs) from the last ERDS in the chain. Intermediate nodes implement data/ERDS evidence trusted relay. They can also implement additional functionalities like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>protocol gateway;</p></li>
<li><p>data/ERDS evidence validation;</p></li>
<li><p>data/ERDS evidence repository.</p></li>

<p>)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Figure 6: Extended electronic registered delivery basic flow</p>
<p>It appears that, while the users still perceive the service as a black-box, several interactions take place in between. The sample flow introduces Intermediate ERDS 1 (1-ERDS) and Intermediate ERDS 2 (2-ERDS). Single ERDSs only support transparent relay of messages. This architecture, however, also supports non-transparent relay, enabling extra services like semantic conversion, signature validation, business workflow, etc. In this case an application layer on top of the ERDSs will be in charge (and assume the liability) of message transformation.</p>
<p>In the sample flow different ERDSs interact via different Commons: CommonS1 is the shared infrastructure between S-ERDS and 1-ERDS, etc. This is the case when intermediate ERDSs act as gateway between different administrative/trust domains.</p>
<p>In steps 18, 19, 20, 23, 24 and 25 the ERDS evidence of consignment and handover flows back across the different ERDSs, since each of them needs to close their own transaction.</p>

<p>Figure 7 presents the interfaces which emerge from the above models. The 4-corner model has been considered since it contains all the elements, while the extended model is a straightforward generalization.</p>
<p>Figure 7: Interfaces</p>
<p>ERDS MSI (Message Submission Interface): this interface is used by the sender’s ERD-UA to submit original messages to the sender’s ERDS, for them to be forwarded to the recipient(s). This interface shall require authentication, either direct (e.g. through credential check) or indirect (e.g. though a token from a third party). This interface shall implement confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>ERDS MERI (Message and Evidence Retrieval Interface): this interface is used by the ERD-UA to retrieve user content, handover metadata and associated evidence (pull mode). This interface shall require authentication, either direct (e.g. through credential check) or indirect (e.g. though a token from a third party). This interface shall implement confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>ERD-UA MEPI (Message and Evidence Push Interface): this interface is used to push user content and/or associated evidence to the ERD-UA. This interface shall implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>ERDS RI(Relay Interface): this interface allows ERD messages to be relayed between ERDS. This interface shall implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity preserving measures.</p>
<p>CSI (Common Service Interface): this interface gives access to message routing functions, trust management functions, capability management functions, governance functions.</p>
<p>An ERDS shall implement ERDS MSI, and either ERDS MERI or ERDS MEPI (or both). These interfaces are not further specified in any part of this multi-part deliverable.</p>
<p>NOTE: While standardization of interfaces ERDS MSI and ERDS MERI does not affect interoperability between different ERDS, it can however be relevant for easing the user when switching from a provider to another, especially when an application interface is involved.</p>
<p>An interoperable ERDS shall implement ERDS RI. It should implement ERDS RI according to the ETSI EN 319 522 parts 3 [i.6], 4-1 [i.7] and 4-2 [i.8].</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.11. </span>4 Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The present document specifies the semantic content that flows across the interfaces which have been identified in ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1]. No requirements are introduced on the specific formats for the content; formats are specified in ETSI EN 319 522-3 [i.7]. Figure 1 outlines how data flows through the interfaces in the four corner model. User content shall not be changed by ERDSs. Data flowing between systems is always encrypted, as specified by the applicable binding. As detailed below, not all objects are always required.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Data flowing through interfaces For convenience, the present document defines (table 1) some aggregate constructs (ERD dispatch, ERDS receipt, ERDS serviceInfo, ERD payload, original message) which package the basic objects (user content, ERDS relay metadata, ERDS evidence, submission metadata) in different modes. Constructs define the semantic information flowing between parties, so they ease the definition of bindings [3] [4], even if, specific bindings may split the construct in its basic objects for transport. The naming convention used in the present document is that constructs whose content is completely generated by the ERDS are prefixed with «ERDS», while constructs whose content includes user generated data is prefixed with «ERD». Table 1 specifies the composition of constructs as a collection of basic objects. Table 1: Composition of constructs Basic object Construct user content ERDS relay metadata ERDS evidence submission metadata ERD message ERD dispatch 1 1 1..n 0 ERDS receipt 0 1 1..n 0 ERDS serviceInfo 0 1 0 0 ERD payload 1 1 0 0 original message 1 0 0 0..1 Table 2 provides an abstract specification of the functions provided by the ERDS APIs as defined in ETSI EN 319 522-1 [1].</p>
<p>Table 2: Abstract interfaces Interface Provided function Description Arguments and output ERDS MSI out := SubmitMessage(og) The method is used for posting an original message to the S-ERDS. In order to use the SubmitMessage API, the UA/Application has to prove that the sender is the owner of the sender’s identifier (via an authentication token, a challenge response, etc.). og: original message, composed of user content and (optional) submission metadata. out: the outcome of the method. There is no specification on the outcome, which may be a simple success/error indication, or may include a message identifier or a larger set of information. ERDS MERI out :=RetrieveMessage (mi) The method is used for retrieving a user content from the R-ERDS. Alternatively, a push of the user content to the recipient UA/application can be used through the ERD-UA MEPI interface In order to use the RetrieveMessageAPI, the UA/Application has to prove that the recipient is the owner of the recipient’s identifier (via an authentication token, a challenge response, etc.). mi: this is a set of parameters which is used for the identification and retrieval of the requested user content. out: this is the outcome of the method, which, in case of success, includes the user content and possibly handover metadata and ERDS evidence. In case of failure the outcome will include error information. e := GetEvidences(ei) The method is used for retrieving one or more evidences associated to a user content which has previously been managed by the ERDS. Note that this is not the only way to obtain evidence, since an evidence can be transmitted in different ways (e.g. as an output of the SubmitMessage or the RetrieveMessage). ei: this is a set of parameters which is used for the identification and retrieval of the requested evidence. e: the requested evidences. ERD-UA MEPI out := HandoverObjects(o) The method is used for handing over user content, ERDS evidence, handover metadata to the ERD-UA. o: a combination of user content [0..1], ERDS evidence [0..n], handover metadata [0..1], excluding void. out: this is the outcome of the method, which is a success/failure indication plus error information in case of failure. ERDS RI out := Relay(em) The method is used for relaying an ERD message to a different ERDS. Relaying is used when S-ERDS has not the capability to deliver to the recipient itself. Metadata and evidences may be transmitted with the user content or independently from the user content through this method. em: ERD message. out: this is the outcome of the method, which is a success/failure indication plus error information in case of failure. It may also include an evidence and ERDS relay metadata. CSI re:= LookupERDS(ri) This method is used to identify the ERDS which has the capability to deliver to a defined recipient. The method may return more than one ERDS. ri: unique identification of the recipient, which may be one identifier or a set of attributes that together provides unique identification (e.g. id, domain, application protocol, etc.). re: one or more endpoints of the ERDS(s) which has(have) the capability to deliver to the recipient identified by ri. out := ValidateERDS(ei, p) This method may be used to validate the inclusion of an ERDS intro a trust circle. The method may receive some parameters for the validation (e.g. date and time of validity, specific trust circle, etc.). ei: a unique identifier for the ERDS. p: a set of parameters for the validation out: the outcome of the check, which may include a set of information about the ERDS from a trust perspective. em := GetERDSMetadata (ei) This method is used to retrieve operational metadata about a specific ERDS. ei: a unique identifier for the ERDS. em: a set of information about the ERDS from an operational perspective (capabilities, requirements, endpoints).</p>
<p>The following clauses specify the semantics of the data which are transported through the interfaces; in particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clause 5 specifies the semantics of the components required for identifying the sender and the recipient.</p></li>
<li><p>Clause 6 specifies the semantics of ERDS relay metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>Clause 8 specifies the semantics of ERDS Evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Clause 9 specifies the semantics of information for Common Service Interface.</p></li>

<p>User content may consist of one or more digitally signed documents. Such signatures belong to the application protocol and are out of scope of the present document. NOTE: Signatures on user content will often not be available to the ERDS since the user content can be encrypted end-to-end between sender and receiver. An ERDS shall digitally sign all ERD messages. Such signatures will usually be internal to the ERDS and shall be verified when the ERD message is conveyed to an ERDS-RI interface. Signature on ERD messages are used for ERDS-to-ERDS non repudiation and integrity and do not need to be validated by end users. The subject generating the digital signature on the ERD message (i.e. the entity named in the corresponding certificate) may be a legal or natural person or some other entity, e.g. a device or logical component. Each evidence shall be digitally signed as an individual document by the ERDS issuing the evidence, even when the evidence is embedded in a signed ERD message. This ensures that an evidence can be extracted from an ERD message if necessary and delivered to sender, receiver or other parties, or be archived, as an individual, protected document. A digital signature on an evidence shall be verifiable by any party; this means that the entire certificate chain supporting the signature shall be available and that certificate status information for these certificates shall be openly available. Messages exchanged with the Common Service Interface may be digitally signed; this may apply to both requests and responses. Requirements may exist for digitally signing metadata stored in a CSI metadata repository and for conveying these metadata in their signed form.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.14.2. </span>7.2 Common requirements for digital signatures<a class="headerlink" href="#common-requirements-for-digital-signatures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For all digital signatures applied by ERDSs to ERD messages and ERDS evidence: NOTE 1: Digital signatures exchanged with the Common Services Infrastructure are not affected by these requirements. 1) The digital signature should be a CAdES, XAdES or PAdES baseline signature as specified in ETSI EN 319 122-1 [i.11], ETSI EN 319 132-1 [i.12], ETSI EN 319 142-1 [i.13]. NOTE 2: A XAdES signature can be regarded as the best option for SOAP-based ERD services, while CAdES signatures can be a better alternative in Registered Electronic Mail environments. NOTE 3: As no part of this multi-part deliverable specifies use of PDF documents, no further requirements are posed for use of PAdES. An example of use is an ERDS that issues PDF-formatted evidences to its subscribers and signs these evidences using PAdES. 2) The digital signature shall use cryptographic algorithms of sufficient strength, e.g. as recommended by ETSI TS 119 312 [i.5]. 3) The digital signature may include a signed property containing the explicit identifier of the signature policy governing the signing and/or validating processes. 4) A signature time-stamp should be added to the digital signature of evidence; when a CAdES or XAdES signature is used, the B-T signature level should be used.</p>
<p>NOTE 4: When the digital signature individually signs an ERDS evidence, the incorporation of the signature timestamp is an indirect time-stamp on the ERDS evidence itself. This time-stamp token supports requirements related to the time-stamping of ERDS evidences that can be defined by different regulatory or legal frameworks; in particular, this can support the requirements on time-stamping defined by the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1], Article 44.</p>

<p>The CSI component is needed when sender and recipient(s) are served by different ERDSs. As identified by part 1 of this multi-part deliverable [1], this component for the 4-corner model and the extended model may have four purposes: 1) Message routing. 2) Trust establishment. 3) Capability management. 4) Governance support. These purposes are described below, with trust establishment and governance in the same clause.</p>

<section id="erd-message-routing">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.16.2. </span>9.2 ERD message routing<a class="headerlink" href="#erd-message-routing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>By use of the CSI component, an S-ERDS shall be able to identify the R-ERDS of which the recipient is a subscriber, see clause 9.4.2. When the S-ERDS and the R-ERDS are directly connected, e.g. in the 4-corner model, the ERDS relay interfaces (ERDS RI) of the two ERDSs shall be identified, in order for the S-ERDS to route ERD messages to the R-ERDS; correspondingly for evidences between the two ERDSs. The format of the ERDS RI identification depends on technology; as one example, a URI format may be used. Multi-hop routing of an ERD message or evidence via a path consisting of one or more I-ERDSs is out of scope of the present document. NOTE 1: One possibility is to configure multi-hop routing locally at the S-ERDS based on knowledge of the topography of the interconnection of ERDSs. NOTE 2: An example of a topology is the situation where all ERDSs are connected to one I-ERDS that provides an interconnecting infrastructure. The S-ERDS will forward to the ERDS RI interface to the interconnecting I-ERDS, which in turn will forward to the ERDS RI interface to the R-ERDS. Before forwarding the ERD message, the S-ERDS shall establish trust in the ERDS it is forwarding to (see clause 9.3), should obtain the full path to that ERDS, and shall assess that the ERDS has the capabilities necessary (see clause 9.4) to fulfil the S-ERDS” policy for the ERD message.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.16.3. </span>9.3 ERDS trust establishment and governance<a class="headerlink" href="#erds-trust-establishment-and-governance" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an ERD message needs forwarding to another ERDS, trust in the other ERDS shall be evaluated. An ERDS shall not relay an ERD message to another ERDS, unless it can identify and authenticate the other ERDS and can confirm that the identified ERDS is trusted. Trust is defined as the existence of a trust domain within which co-operation between participating ERDSs is regulated. The specific conditions (policies) for a trust domain may vary; the present document has no requirements on how a trust domain is established or governed. Typically, parameters such as responsibilities, possibilities for claiming recourse in case of breaches, and payment are defined for a trust domain. A trust domain shall have governance, at least for the policy regarding conditions for an ERDS to join. A trust domain may be established bilaterally between two or more ERDSs; in this case the governance should be through explicit or implicit agreements. A trust domain may require specific policy, security, and technical conditions to be met by all participating ERDSs. If this is the case, the capabilities of the participating ERDSs may be implicit from the participation in the trust domain. In other cases, both trust in and capabilities (metadata) of the other ERDS shall be assessed.</p>
<p>Trust may be established unilaterally, meaning an ERDS may trust another ERDS but not the other way around. It may also happen that an ERDS trusts all participants of a trust domain without being itself a member of that trust domain. This implies that ERD dispatches and ERD payload can be sent in one direction (if the ERDS and/or trust domain policy accepts receiving from outside), but not in the opposite direction. If such one-way sending of ERD messages is used, the R-ERDS shall provide evidences to the S-ERDS. Participation in a trust domain should be assessed by an X.509 certificate representing an ERDS in the trust domain. By use of this certificate, or certificates derived from it, ERDSs can be authenticated towards one another, and ERD messages and evidences can be signed and encrypted between ERDSs. Information about ERDSs participating in specific trust domains may be found by the following means: 1) Locally configured by exchange of information, including certificates, between the involved ERDSs. 2) Maintaining a trust domain Trust Status List (TSL), typically a responsibility of an actor co-ordinating the trust domain, termed the «scheme operator» by ETSI TS 119 612 [i.6]. An X.509 certificate represents the «service digital identity» of the ERDS in the TSL. 3) As a special case of TSL, the European Trust List system will list ERDSs which are qualified in the sense of eIDAS Regulation [i.1]; and the trust domain may be defined as «all qualified ERDSs». 4) The trust domain may be defined by a domain PKI issuing X.509 certificates to all participating ERDSs. 5) Metadata on capabilities of an ERDS may be extended to contain trust domain information; this is out of scope of the present document.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.16.4.1. </span>9.4.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Capability management shall provide the functionality to resolve the unique identification of a recipient into: 1) Identification of the R-ERDS of which the recipient is a subscriber. 2) Metadata for the capabilities of this ERDS. 3) Metadata for the capabilities of the recipient in this ERDS. A recipient may be a subscriber of several ERDSs, in which case the unique identification of the recipient shall either include identification of the ERDS (see clause 9.4.2 item 1)) or further information such as application protocol or message type identification that through lookup in recipient metadata will identify the ERDS that serves the recipient for this ERD message. NOTE: An example is a business actor (typically a legal person) that uses the services of one ERDS for procurement orders and another ERDS for invoices.</p>

<p>The R-ERDS may be explicitly identified by the identifier of the recipient, e.g. when this is on an email format receiverID&#64;ERDS.domain. When the identification of the recipient is by other means than an identifier, identification of the ERDS may be explicit by a separate parameter (in submission metadata). However, a recipient may also be uniquely identified by an identifier (scheme name and value, see clause 5.2) that is not bound to identification of the R-ERDS, or by a set of identity attributes that together provide unique identification, see clause 5.3, and without identification of R-ERDS as separate parameter; e.g. the sender may not know which ERDS that serves the recipient. In this case, either: 1) the S-ERDS may be able to locally decide the identity of the R-ERDS, e.g. based on identifier scheme name or specific identity attributes like country; or 2) the R-ERDS may be identified through lookup in recipient metadata; as stated above, further parameters in submission metadata may be used in the identification of the R-ERDS.</p>

<section id="recipient-metadata">
<h4><span class="section-number">6.16.4.3. </span>9.4.3 Recipient metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#recipient-metadata" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The capabilities of a recipient may be implicit from the ERDS metadata; the conditions for becoming a subscriber of an ERDS may require all subscribers to fulfil certain requirements. In other cases, recipient metadata shall be available for the S-ERDS to determine if an ERD message can be forwarded to this recipient or not. The present document does not assume that metadata for all recipients is in the same place. When recipient metadata is used, the CSI shall provide functionality to derive a unique address for the recipient’s metadata, e.g. a URI, from the recipient identification. Recipient metadata repositories may be organized in different manners: 1) One metadata repository may be provided for an ERDS; when the ERDS is identified, all metadata for its subscribers will be in one place. 2) One metadata repository may span several ERDSs. 3) Recipients may be allowed to manage their own metadata repositories, mostly relevant for legal persons. When recipient metadata is used in the ERDS provisioning, an ERDS shall ensure that sufficient metadata about all subscribers is stored, maintained, and made available. Depending on the identification of the recipient and the technology used for the ERDS, different organizations of metadata repositories can be used, as well as different mechanisms to locate and access the recipient metadata. No requirements are posed here but specifications for specific ERDS technologies may pose requirements. The content of recipient metadata depends on the specific ERDS technologies used. No requirements are posed here but specifications for specific ERDS technologies may pose requirements.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.16.4.4. </span>9.4.4 ERDS capability metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#erds-capability-metadata" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>An ERDS shall not relay an ERD message to another ERDS unless it can assess that the other ERDS can provide a service respecting the constraints and options defined in the applicable ERD policy. The assessment may be based on both ERDSs participating in the same trust domain (see clause 9.3) if the trust domain policy ensures that all participating ERDSs have the same capabilities. In other cases, a decision on forwarding of an ERD message depends on evaluation of capabilities (metadata) about the other ERDS. If ERDS metadata is needed, an ERDSP shall ensure that capability metadata for the ERDS is stored, maintained, and made available. Two alternatives exist: 1) the CSI shall provide functionality to derive a unique address for the ERDS metadata repository, e.g. a URI, from the ERDS identification; or 2) ERDS metadata shall be stored as part of recipient metadata, meaning a lookup on recipient metadata returns information also on the ERDS. Metadata on capabilities of an ERDS shall include the attributes listed in table 14.</p>

ERDS domain name Domain name of ERDS for DNS lookup, etc. ERDS governing body Identification of the ERDSP providing the ERDS.

<p>Each instance of AssuranceLevelsDetailsType shall convey either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a global assurance level jointly assigned to the identification proof and authentication processes, supported by     the GlobalAssuranceLevel and AuthenticationDetails children elements, or</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.12.1. </span>5.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The present clause defines an XML format for ERDS evidence components identified in ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1], clause 8.</p>
<p>ERDS can generate PDF-formatted ERDS evidences. This format, although valid, is thought more for final human usage rather than in situations where interoperability has to be addressed or automatic processes have to take some decision based on ERDS evidence content.</p>
<p>XML format is better suited for these last cases, where the automatic processing of the evidence content prevails over its immediate human interpretation. For the aforementioned reasons, the detailed specification of PDF evidence format is out of scope of the present document.</p>
<p>In clause 5.2, all XML elements are given for information only. In case of conflict with the XML Schema file whose location is detailed in clause A.1, it is the Schema file which takes precedence.</p>

<p>Attribute version shall implement the semantics of component MD01 as specified in clause 6.2.1 of ETSI EN 319 522-2 [1].</p>
<p>Below, the ERDS capability metadata defined above is specified as an extension to the OASIS Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) specification [8]. The extension should be added to the ServiceEndpointList or to the specific ServiceEndpoints. Note that according to SMP [8], extensions may be ignored. The capabilities described by the ERDS metadata are common to all ERDS RIs exposed by the ERDS. By defining this as an extension to SMP, the existing SMP ServiceMetadata definition does not need to be changed, and metadata about an ERDS can be located in SMP.</p>
<p>The SMP specification has a standard format for specification of extensions. The extension shall follow the pseudo-schema in clause 2.3.2.2 of SMP [8] concerning identification of the extension and the responsible agency. Clause 2.3.2.3 of SMP [8] describes the semantics of the individual fields (elements and attributes) of this pseudo-schema and the schema bdx-smp-201605.xsd copied into appendix B of SMP [8] provides the XML schema. The ERDS capability metadata shall be encoded in the xs:any part of the pseudo-schema.</p>
<p>For ERDSMetadata as an extension to SMP, the following values shall be used for identification of the extension and the responsible agency:</p>
<p>ExtensionID: «ERDSMetadata» ExtensionName: «ERDSMetadata» ExtensionAgencyID: «ETSI» ExtensionAgencyName: «European Telecommunications Standards Institute» ExtensionAgencyURI: «http://www.etsi.org» ExtensionVersionID: Same as version attribute of the ERDS metadata ExtensionURI: «http://uri.etsi.org/19522/v1#ERDSMetadata» ExtensionReasonCode: «ERDSMetadata» ExtensionReason: «Publish capability metadata for an Electronic Registered Delivery Service»</p>
<p>Other methods for distribution of ERDS metadata are for further study. Registration of the ERDS itself in an SMP as a participant is possible but would require changes to the SMP specification. ERDS metadata may be published as a service information extension in a TSL according to clause 5.5.9 of ETSI TS 119 612 [i.9]; however no requirement is specified to this effect.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">8.8. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>An «Electronic Registered Delivery Service (ERDS hereinafter)» provides secure and reliable delivery of electronic messages between parties, producing evidence of the delivery process for legal accountability. Evidence can be seen as a declaration by a trusted party that a specific event related to the delivery process (submission of a message, delivery of a message, refusal of a message, etc.) happened at a certain time. Evidence can be immediately delivered to the interested party (together with the message or separately) or can be kept in a repository for later access by interested parties. It is common practice to implement evidence as digitally signed data.</p>
<p>The above stated ERDS concept can be implemented in diverse ways, using different formats for identifiers and evidences, using different protocols for messaging, and even different message delivery models.</p>
<p>It is expected that the provision of these kind of services and the providers themselves will be suitably regulated within different regulatory or legal framework.</p>
<p>Particularly within the European Union Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 hereinafter) [i.1] provides a legal framework to facilitate cross-border recognition between existing national legal systems related to electronic registered delivery services. That framework aims to open new market opportunities for European Union trust service providers to offer new pan-European electronic registered delivery services.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] defines the so-called Qualified Electronic Registered Delivery Services (QERDS hereinafter). QERDS is a special type of ERDS. Both the service and the provider providing it meet a number of additional requirements that the regular ERDS and its providers do not need to meet.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">9.8. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Business and administrative relationships among companies, public administrations and private citizens are more and more implemented electronically. Trust is essential for their success and continued development of electronic services. It is therefore important that any entity using electronic services have suitable security controls and mechanisms in place to protect their transactions and to ensure trust and confidence with their partners.</p>
<p>Electronic signatures are commonly used worldwide to ensure authenticity and integrity of electronic documents, making it possible to transform traditional paper-based processes into electronic ones providing a comparable or even higher level of assurance. As communication is becoming predominantly internet-based, secure and provable exchange of documents is essential to the full digital transformation.</p>
<p>An electronic registered delivery service (ERDS hereinafter) provides secure and reliable delivery of electronic messages between parties, producing evidence of the delivery process for legal accountability. Evidence can be seen as a declaration by a trusted party that a specific event related to the delivery process (submission of a message, relay of a message, delivery of a message, refusal of a message, etc.) happened at a certain time. Evidence can be immediately delivered to the interested party (together with the message or separately) or can be kept in a repository for later access. It is common practice to implement evidence as digitally signed data. Registered electronic mail (REM hereinafter) is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, which builds on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging.</p>
<p>In a number of national, regional or sector-specific communities electronic registered delivery and registered electronic mail services are already in place, and even more are being developed. Without the definition of common standards there will be no consistency in the services provided, making it difficult for users to compare them. Under these circumstances, users might be prevented from easily changing to alternative providers, damaging free competition. Lack of standardization might also adversely affect interoperability between implementations which are based on different models.</p>
<p>The documents covering ERDS contain the general concepts and requirements which apply to all kinds of electronic registered delivery services. Since REM is a specific type of electronic registered delivery, the documents covering REM service build on the corresponding documents covering ERDS by referencing the necessary provisions, and define the interpretation and specific requirements which apply only to registered electronic mail.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [i.1] (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or Regulation hereinafter) provides a legal framework to facilitate cross-border recognition between existing national legal systems related to electronic registered delivery services. That framework aims to open new market opportunities for European Union trust service providers to offer new pan-European electronic registered delivery services. The Regulation defines the so-called qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS hereinafter), which is a special type of ERDS, where both the service and its provider need to meet a number of additional requirements that the regular ERDSs and their providers do not need to meet.</p>
<p>The framework of ERDS standards aims to cover the common and worldwide-recognized requirements to address electronic registered delivery in a secure and reliable way, independent of the applicable legislative framework. The documents contain generic requirements which can be applied in any geographic region. At the same time, the framework of ERDS standards aims to support demonstrating compliance to the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] (and related secondary legislation), both for non-qualified and qualified electronic registered delivery services. Specific clauses are included defining requirements applicable only to qualified electronic registered delivery services, especially in the documents covering policy and security requirements. However, the legal effects are outside the scope of the present document.</p>

<p>Electronic commerce, in its broadest sense, is a way of doing business and communicating across public and private networks. An important requirement of electronic commerce is the ability to identify the originator and protect the confidentiality of electronic exchanges. This is commonly achieved by using cryptographic mechanisms which are supported by a Trust Service Provider (TSP) issuing certificates, commonly called a Certification Authority (CA).</p>
<p>For participants of electronic commerce to have confidence in the security of these cryptographic mechanisms they need to have confidence that the TSP has properly established procedures and protective measure in order to minimize the operational and financial threats and risks associated with public key cryptographic systems.</p>
<p>The present document is aiming to meet the general requirements of the international community to provide trust and confidence in electronic transactions including, amongst others, applicable requirements from Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.14] and those from CA/Browser Forum, BRG [5].</p>
<p>Bodies wishing to establish policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates in a regulatory context other than the EU can base their requirements on those specified in the present document and specify any additional requirements in a manner similar to ETSI EN 319 411-2 [i.5], which builds on the present document requirements so as to benefit from the use of generally accepted global best practices.</p>

<section id="scope">
<h2><span class="section-number">10.7. </span>1 Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The present document specifies generally applicable policy and security requirements for Trust Service Providers (TSPs) issuing public key certificates, including trusted web site certificates.</p>
<p>The policy and security requirements are defined in terms of requirements for the issuance, maintenance and life-cycle management of certificates. These policy and security requirements support several reference certificate policies, defined in clauses 4 and 5.</p>
<p>A framework for the definition of policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates in a specific context where particular requirements apply is defined in clause 7.</p>
<p>The present document covers requirements for CA hierarchies, however this is limited to supporting the policies as specified in the present document. It does not include requirements for root CAs and intermediate CAs for other purposes.</p>
<p>The present document is applicable to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the general requirements of certification in support of cryptographic mechanisms, including digital signatures     for electronic signatures and seals;</p></li>
<li><p>the general requirements of certification authorities issuing TLS/SSL certificates;</p></li>
<li><p>the general requirements of the use of cryptography for authentication and encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The present document does not specify how the requirements identified can be assessed by an independent party, including requirements for information to be made available to such independent assessors, or requirements on such assessors.</p>
<p>NOTE: See ETSI EN 319 403 [i.2] for guidance on assessment of TSP’s processes and services. The present document references ETSI EN 319 401 [8] for general policy requirements common to all classes of TSP’s services.</p>
<p>The present document includes provisions consistent with the requirements from the CA/Browser Forum in EVCG [4] and BRG [5].</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">10.11.2.1. </span>4.2.1 Certification Practice Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#certification-practice-statement" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In general, the Certificate Policy (CP) (see clause 4.2.2), referenced by a policy identifier in a certificate, states «what is to be adhered to», while a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) states «how it is adhered to», i.e. the processes the TSP will use in creating and maintaining the certificate. The TSP issuing certificates develops, implements, enforces, and updates a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) which is a trust service practice statement such as defined in ETSI EN 319 401 [8]. See clause 5.2.</p>
<p>The CPS describes how the TSP operates its service and is owned by the TSP: it is tailored to the organizational structure, operating procedures, facilities, and computing environment of the TSP. The CPS defines how the TSP meets the technical, organizational and procedural requirements identified in a Certificate Policy (CP) (see clause 4.2.2). For example, where the CP requires secure management of the private key(s), the CPS can describe the dual-control, secure storage practices, and so on, relying on operational procedures that in turn can provide the details with locations, access lists and access procedures.</p>
<p>NOTE: The operational procedures mentioned above can be in low-level documents providing the specific details necessary to complete the practices identified in the CPS. This documentation is generally regarded as internal, e.g. defining specific tasks and responsibilities within the organization. Such documentation can be used in the daily operation of the TSP and reviewed by those doing a process review, but due to its internal nature it is considered private and proprietary and therefore beyond the scope of the present document. The published CPS can thus be limited to the information useful for subscribers/subject and relying parties, and be completed by (confidential) elements that do not have to be disclosed.</p>
<p>The target audience of the practice statements can be the auditors, the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.</p>
<p>The present document provides requirements identified as necessary to support state-of-the-art certification services built on best practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="certificate-policy">
<h4><span class="section-number">10.11.2.2. </span>4.2.2 Certificate Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#certificate-policy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A Certificate policy (CP) describes what the certificate is in terms of quality (requirements to be adhered to), profile, applicability, etc. It can contain diverse information beyond the scope of the present document to indicate the applicability of the service (e.g. the detailed description of the certificate profile). A CP is a specific type of trust service policy as defined in ETSI EN 319 401 [8]. According to ETSI EN 319 401 [8], it is mandatory for a TSP to identify the trust service policies it supports. Such policy is defined independently of the specific details of the specific operating environment of a TSP and is not necessarily part of the TSP’s documentation; practice statement and general terms and conditions are sufficient.</p>
<p>Following ETSI EN 319 401 [8], a CP can apply to several TSPs supporting a user community that abide by the common set of rules specified in that CP. A CP can be defined, for example: by the TSP, by a third party (e.g. standardisation organisations such as ETSI), by national government or international organizations, by the customers (subscribers) of the TSP or by the users of certification services. The CPS is defined by the TSP.</p>
<p>When the TSP does not issue its own CP, it is expected that the TSP provides minimal information about the certification service it offers in its documentation (CPS or terms and conditions (see clause 4.2.3), including the indication that it complies with all rules valid for a given referred CP, in the case of the present document as specified in clause 5 or clause 7. The present document does not put constraints on the form of the CPs; a CP can be a stand-alone document or be provided as part of the practice statements and/or the general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The target audience of the CP can be the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.</p>
<p>NOTE: Subscribers and relying parties can consult the CPS and/or terms and conditions of the issuing TSP to obtain details how the CP is implemented by the TSP. These documents can refer to each other.</p>
<p>For certification services, the identification of the CP is communicated through the documentation provided to the subscribers and relying parties and in addition, as described in IETF RFC 3647 [i.3], clause 3.3, certificates include a CP identifier which can be used by relying parties in determining the certificates” suitability and trustworthiness for a particular application.</p>
<p>TSP conforming to the present document’s normative requirements may use OIDs defined in the present document in its documentation and in the certificates it issues. The present document defines seven CPs:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP) which meets general recognized best practice for TSPs issuing certificates used in support of any type of transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>An extended Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP+) which offers the same quality as that offered by the NCP for use where a secure cryptographic device (signing or decrypting) is considered necessary. The requirements for this CP include the policy requirements for the issuance and management of NCP certificates.</p></li>
<li><p>A Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) offering a quality of service less onerous than the NCP (requiring less demanding policy requirements) for use where a risk assessment does not justify the additional burden of meeting all requirements of the NCP (e.g. physical presence), for certificates used in support of any type of transaction (such as digital signatures, web authentication).</p></li>
<li><p>An Extended Validation Certificate Policy (EVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for EVC. The requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of NCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from EVCG [4]. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support EVC issuance and management as specified in EVCG [4].</p></li>
<li><p>A Domain Validation Certificate Policy (DVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for DVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from the BRG [5] as applicable to domain validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support DVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].</p></li>
<li><p>An Organizational Validation Certificate Policy (OVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for OVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from BRG [5] as applicable to organizational validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support OVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].</p></li>
<li><p>An Individual Validation Certificate Policy (IVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for IVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from the BRG [5] as applicable to individual validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support IVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The above CPs can be used as they are without amendments but can also be used as a basis for creating more elaborate policies; clause 7 specifies a framework for other CPs which enhance or further constrain the above policies.</p>

<p>A TSP is required to issue terms and conditions (see clause 6.9.4). This can be as part of the CPS or the CP if issued by the TSP. Alternatively, this can be a standalone document. The terms and conditions are specific to a TSP. The target audience of the terms and conditions can be the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.</p>
<p>The PKI disclosure statement is that part of the TSP’s terms and conditions which relate to the operation of the PKI.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: The present document does not mandate any sub division of the services of a TSP. Requirements are stated in subsequent clauses.</p>
<p>The certification services are broken down in the present document into the following component services for the purposes of classifying requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Registration service: verifies the identity and if applicable, any specific attributes of a subject. The results of     this service are passed to the certificate generation service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 2: This service includes proof of possession of, or control over, non-CA generated subject private keys.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other attributes verified     by the registration service. This can include key generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents, makes them available     to relying parties. This service also makes available the TSP’s terms and conditions, and any published policy     and practice information, to subscribers and relying parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to determine the     necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed through the revocation status service.</p></li>
<li><p>Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Subject device provision service (optional): prepares, and provides or makes available secure cryptographic     devices, or other secure devices, to subjects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 3: Examples of this service are:</p>
<p> a service which generates the subject’s key pair and distributes the private key to the subject (this includes «soft» keys i.e. keys protected by software environment);</p>
<p> a service which prepares the subject’s signature-creation module and enabling codes and distributes the module to the registered subject.</p>
<p>This subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarification of policy requirements and places no restrictions on any subdivision of an implementation of the TSP’s services.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">10.13.4.1. </span>5.4.1 Certification Authority<a class="headerlink" href="#certification-authority" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A CA is commonly understood to be a type of Trust Service Provider (TSP), as defined in the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.14], and also a form of certification service provider as defined in the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC [i.1], which issues public key certificates. However, in the present document the term is used more to reference the technical component of the TSP concerned with certificate issuance.</p>
<p>The authority trusted by the users of the certification services (i.e. subscribers as well as relying parties) to assign certificates is the TSP. The TSP has overall responsibility for the provision of the certification services identified in clause 4.3. The CA, as well as the TSP, can be identified in the certificate as the issuer and its private key is used to sign certificates.</p>
<p>OVR-5.4.1-01: The TSP may make use of other parties to provide parts of the certification service.</p>
<p>NOTE: However, the TSP always maintains overall responsibility and ensures that the policy requirements identified in the present document are met (ETSI EN 319 401 [8], requirements REQ-6.3-05 and REQ-6.3-06).</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: A TSP can sub-contract all the component services, including the certificate generation service (referred to as the CA in the present document). However, the key used to sign the certificates is identified as belonging to the CA, and the TSP maintains overall responsibility for meeting the requirements defined in the present document.</p>
<p>OVR-5.4.1-02: A TSP may include a hierarchy of CAs.</p>
<p>OVR-5.4.1-03 [CONDITIONAL]: Where a TSP includes a hierarchy of subordinate CAs up to a root CA, the TSP shall be responsible for ensuring the subordinate-CAs comply with the applicable policy requirements.</p>

<p>OVR-6.6.3-01: The OCSP shall be as defined in IETF RFC 6960 [11].</p>
<p>NOTE 1: A TSP can decide to use the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in the certificate profile of a delegated OCSP responder as described in clause 4.2.2.2.1 (Revocation Checking of an Authorized Responder) of IETF RFC 6960 [11]. In that case, no revocation status information is required for determining the status of the corresponding responder certificate which may be considered as useful for various reasons. However, a TSP who decides to do so takes the following additional risks into account in its risk assessment:</p>
<p> As stipulated in IETF RFC 6960 [11], an OCSP responder key compromise is, in this case, as severe as a compromise of the corresponding issuing CA key. To this reason, the TSP carefully considers OCSP responder key management and particularly considers reducing responder certificate lifetime to a reasonable duration.</p>
<p> Third party applications like SVAs that rely on the TSP’s certificate status information services may not be able to handle this non-critical extension. Consequently they can end up with operational issues when no fall back scenario like complementary provisioning of a CRL is implemented for revealing the responder status, or can end up in invalidating the signature.</p>
<p>This can be documented within the CPS/CP.</p>
<p>OVR-6.6.3-02: If the OCSP responder receives a request for status of a certificate that has not been issued then the responder shall not respond with a «good» status as per clause 2.2 of IETF RFC 6960 [11].</p>
<p>NOTE 2: When both OCSP and CRL are provided, the TSP needs to configure OCSP answers for non-issued certificates in a way which is appropriate to meet the consistency requirement CSS-6.3.10-09. In particular, if the responder sends a «revoked» response, the non-issued reason needs to be identifiable (knowing that non-issued certificates do not appear in a CRL).</p>
<p>OVR-6.6.3-03: The CA should monitor such requests concerning non-issued certificates on the responder as part of its security response procedures to check if this is an indication of an attack.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">10.19. </span>A.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#a-1-introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The proposed model PKI disclosure statement is for use as a supplemental instrument of disclosure and notice by a TSP. A PKI disclosure statement may assist a TSP to respond to regulatory requirements and concerns, particularly those related to consumer deployment. Further, the aim of the model PKI disclosure statement is to foster industry «self-regulation» and build consensus on those elements of a CP and/or CPS that require emphasis and disclosure.</p>
<p>Although CP and CPS documents are essential for describing and governing certificate policies and practices, many PKI users, especially consumers, find these documents difficult to understand. Consequently, there is a need for a supplemental and simplified instrument that can assist PKI users in making informed trust decisions. Consequently, a PKI disclosure statement is not intended to replace a CP or CPS.</p>
<p>This annex provides an example of the structure for a PKI disclosure statement.</p>

<p>Date Version Information about changes February 2016 1.1.1 Publication</p>
<p>June 2017 1.2.0</p>
<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of the changes carried out since V1.1.1.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All requirements numbered as per clause 3.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirement numbering; all requirements are identified by a unique number.</p></li>
<li><p>New versions of the CA/B Forum documents are considered (EVCG V.1.6.1 for     ECVP], and BRG v1.4.2 for PTC).</p></li>
<li><p>Several editorial changes and clarifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptation of definitions for CRL and CARL.</p></li>
<li><p>New definitions for revocation and domain name.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification on the concepts CA and TSP (and consistent application thorough     the document).</p></li>
<li><p>Addition of a CP, the IVCP, for certificates that includes validated individual     identity information for the subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification on subject device provisioning service to cover the fact that it     includes «soft keys» management.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification that Identity validation is part of at least one of processes:     certificate application, certificate issuance, subject device provisioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification of requirement mentioning «issuing certificates considering the     expiry date of the CA certificate» with «issuing certificates whose lifetime     exceeds that of the CA’s signing certificate» and further specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification of requirement on DN re-assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification of requirements with regard to the subscriber agreement that does     not need to be «signed» anymore but «ratified».</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification of requirements with regard to the «confirmation that the     information in the certificate is correct» by «the information to be held in the     certificate is correct» and allowing to do this by reference (to the CP e.g.).</p></li>
<li><p>Alleviation of obligation to notify the subject in case of revocation (e.g. this may     be impossible if the subject is dead).</p></li>
<li><p>Definition of a value for the CRL nextUpdate field when the CRL is the last one     issued for a certain scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandatory support of CRL or OCSP. OCPS remains recommended, and is     mandatory for certain CPs, but not strictly mandatory for all CPs.</p></li>
<li><p>Trusted Role identified in CEN TS 419 261 should be supported (not     mandatory anymore).</p></li>
<li><p>Extension of some requirements on the CA (certificate signing) keys, to keys     used by revocation and registration services.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional requirements on OCSP profile; if the OCSP responder receives a     request for status of a certificate that has not been issued, then the responder     is mandated not to respond with a «good» status and the TSP should monitor     such requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirement to have subject legal person to ratify a second part of the     subscriber agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional requirement for trustworthy device (HSM) to be operated in its     evaluated configuration as described in the CC guidance documentation or an     equivalent configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarification of the minimal elements to be part of the general terms and     conditions (clause 6.4.9).</p></li>
<li><p>Deletion of text «If the TSPs Trust Anchor is signed by a Root CA outside the     scope of the TSP policies then the Root CA requirements apply to the TSP’s     Trust Anchor.» because the definition of Root-CA is sufficiently clear to this     regard.</p></li>
<li><p>Removal of references to physical presence of the subscriber in clause 6.3.6     (renewal).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Date Version Information about changes</p>
<p>January 2018 1.2.1</p>
<p>Following ENAP public enquiry, the following changes were made. On https://docbox.etsi.org/esi/Open/Compared_deliverables, one will be able to see what changes have taken place between the previous published version (v1.1.1) and this version.</p>
<p>REV-6.2.4-05: replaced «in advance» by «at a future date» and correction of wrong reference. Harmonisation of the use of «electronic signature», «electronic seal» and «digital signature» and reference to the certificate key usage is of type A, B, or F as specified in clause 4.3.2 of ETSI EN 319 412-2 to generalize electronic signatures or seal to usage beyond the eIDAS Regulation (mainly impacting OVR-6.3.5-01 and SDP-6.3.12-03). Reworking of OVR-6.3.5-01 as the requirement was requiring the subscriber’s obligations to literally include items a) to j) expressed below, i.e. a copy paste of the text of the standard and adaptation of OVR-6.3.5-02 accordingly. Addition of REV-6.3.9-02 to require revocation under certain circumstances. Annex B modified to point to ETSI TR 119 411-4 will contain the checklist. April 2018 1.2.2 Publication</p>
<p>September 2020 1.2.3</p>
<p>CR#1 Reshuffling clause 4.2 to align with other ETSI/ESI policy documents CR#2 Revocation processing and delays CR#3 Short term certificates CR#4 Clarify and correct DIS 6.1-01, 02 and 03 CR#5 Clarify OCSP / CRL «consistency» CR#6 «secure user device» versus alternative terms CR#8 Introduce random data in the tbsCertificate CR#9 Corrections to the note under OVR-6.4.3-01 CR#10 Proof of possession or control CR#11 Separate trust service components CR#12 Meaning of ratifying CR#13 Management of private key by TSP CR#14 «Key» revocation CR#15 Importing from ETSI EN 319 411-2 CR#16 Applicability of LCP/NCP requirements to DV etc CR#17 Have references to CABF non-specific CR#18 TSP-RA-Subscriber segregation CR#19 CA Revocation CR#20 Evidence collection and records archival &#64; registration CR#21 SSL certificate subject cannot be legal person CR#22 DVCP and CABF BR requirements re-alignement CR#23 Test certificates CR#24 General clean up CR#25 IETF RFC 5280 subject name size limits CR#26 Correct and clarify certificate modification, rekey and renew CR#27 Clarify CRL update every 24h.</p>
