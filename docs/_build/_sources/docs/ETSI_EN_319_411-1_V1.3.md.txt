## Introduction

Electronic commerce, in its broadest sense, is a way of doing business and communicating across public and private networks. An important requirement of electronic commerce is the ability to identify the originator and protect the confidentiality of electronic exchanges. This is commonly achieved by using cryptographic mechanisms which are supported by a Trust Service Provider (TSP) issuing certificates, commonly called a Certification Authority (CA).

For participants of electronic commerce to have confidence in the security of these cryptographic mechanisms they need to have confidence that the TSP has properly established procedures and protective measure in order to minimize the operational and financial threats and risks associated with public key cryptographic systems.

The present document is aiming to meet the general requirements of the international community to provide trust and confidence in electronic transactions including, amongst others, applicable requirements from Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.14] and those from CA/Browser Forum, BRG [5].

Bodies wishing to establish policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates in a regulatory context other than the EU can base their requirements on those specified in the present document and specify any additional requirements in a manner similar to ETSI EN 319 411-2 [i.5], which builds on the present document requirements so as to benefit from the use of generally accepted global best practices.


## 1 Scope

The present document specifies generally applicable policy and security requirements for Trust Service Providers (TSPs) issuing public key certificates, including trusted web site certificates.

The policy and security requirements are defined in terms of requirements for the issuance, maintenance and life-cycle management of certificates. These policy and security requirements support several reference certificate policies, defined in clauses 4 and 5.

A framework for the definition of policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates in a specific context where particular requirements apply is defined in clause 7.

The present document covers requirements for CA hierarchies, however this is limited to supporting the policies as specified in the present document. It does not include requirements for root CAs and intermediate CAs for other purposes.

The present document is applicable to:

- the general requirements of certification in support of cryptographic mechanisms, including digital signatures     for electronic signatures and seals;

- the general requirements of certification authorities issuing TLS/SSL certificates;

- the general requirements of the use of cryptography for authentication and encryption.

The present document does not specify how the requirements identified can be assessed by an independent party, including requirements for information to be made available to such independent assessors, or requirements on such assessors.

 NOTE: See ETSI EN 319 403 [i.2] for guidance on assessment of TSP's processes and services. The present document references ETSI EN 319 401 [8] for general policy requirements common to all classes of TSP's services.

The present document includes provisions consistent with the requirements from the CA/Browser Forum in EVCG [4] and BRG [5].

 NOTE 2: See ISO/IEC 9594-8/Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6].

Certification Authority (CA): authority trusted by one or more users to create and assign certificates

 NOTE 1: A CA can be:

 1) a trust service provider that creates and assigns public key certificates; or

 2) a technical certificate generation service that is used by a certification service provider that creates and assign public key certificates.

 NOTE 2: See ISO/IEC 9594-8/Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6].

Certification Authority Revocation List (CARL): revocation list containing a list of CA-certificates issued to certification authorities that have been revoked by the certificate issuer

## 4 General concepts

#### 4.1 General policy requirements concepts

See ETSI EN 319 401 [8], clause 4 and IETF RFC 3647 [i.3], clauses 3.1 and 3.4 for guidance.


#### 4.2 Certification Services applicable documentation

##### 4.2.1 Certification Practice Statement

In general, the Certificate Policy (CP) (see clause 4.2.2), referenced by a policy identifier in a certificate, states "what is to be adhered to", while a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) states "how it is adhered to", i.e. the processes the TSP will use in creating and maintaining the certificate. The TSP issuing certificates develops, implements, enforces, and updates a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) which is a trust service practice statement such as defined in ETSI EN 319 401 [8]. See clause 5.2.

The CPS describes how the TSP operates its service and is owned by the TSP: it is tailored to the organizational structure, operating procedures, facilities, and computing environment of the TSP. The CPS defines how the TSP meets the technical, organizational and procedural requirements identified in a Certificate Policy (CP) (see clause 4.2.2). For example, where the CP requires secure management of the private key(s), the CPS can describe the dual-control, secure storage practices, and so on, relying on operational procedures that in turn can provide the details with locations, access lists and access procedures.

 NOTE: The operational procedures mentioned above can be in low-level documents providing the specific details necessary to complete the practices identified in the CPS. This documentation is generally regarded as internal, e.g. defining specific tasks and responsibilities within the organization. Such documentation can be used in the daily operation of the TSP and reviewed by those doing a process review, but due to its internal nature it is considered private and proprietary and therefore beyond the scope of the present document. The published CPS can thus be limited to the information useful for subscribers/subject and relying parties, and be completed by (confidential) elements that do not have to be disclosed.

The target audience of the practice statements can be the auditors, the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.

The present document provides requirements identified as necessary to support state-of-the-art certification services built on best practices.

##### 4.2.2 Certificate Policy

A Certificate policy (CP) describes what the certificate is in terms of quality (requirements to be adhered to), profile, applicability, etc. It can contain diverse information beyond the scope of the present document to indicate the applicability of the service (e.g. the detailed description of the certificate profile). A CP is a specific type of trust service policy as defined in ETSI EN 319 401 [8]. According to ETSI EN 319 401 [8], it is mandatory for a TSP to identify the trust service policies it supports. Such policy is defined independently of the specific details of the specific operating environment of a TSP and is not necessarily part of the TSP's documentation; practice statement and general terms and conditions are sufficient.

Following ETSI EN 319 401 [8], a CP can apply to several TSPs supporting a user community that abide by the common set of rules specified in that CP. A CP can be defined, for example: by the TSP, by a third party (e.g. standardisation organisations such as ETSI), by national government or international organizations, by the customers (subscribers) of the TSP or by the users of certification services. The CPS is defined by the TSP.

When the TSP does not issue its own CP, it is expected that the TSP provides minimal information about the certification service it offers in its documentation (CPS or terms and conditions (see clause 4.2.3), including the indication that it complies with all rules valid for a given referred CP, in the case of the present document as specified in clause 5 or clause 7. The present document does not put constraints on the form of the CPs; a CP can be a stand-alone document or be provided as part of the practice statements and/or the general terms and conditions.

The target audience of the CP can be the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.

 NOTE: Subscribers and relying parties can consult the CPS and/or terms and conditions of the issuing TSP to obtain details how the CP is implemented by the TSP. These documents can refer to each other.

For certification services, the identification of the CP is communicated through the documentation provided to the subscribers and relying parties and in addition, as described in IETF RFC 3647 [i.3], clause 3.3, certificates include a CP identifier which can be used by relying parties in determining the certificates' suitability and trustworthiness for a particular application.


TSP conforming to the present document's normative requirements may use OIDs defined in the present document in its documentation and in the certificates it issues. The present document defines seven CPs:

 1) A Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP) which meets general recognized best practice for TSPs issuing certificates used in support of any type of transaction.

 2) An extended Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP+) which offers the same quality as that offered by the NCP for use where a secure cryptographic device (signing or decrypting) is considered necessary. The requirements for this CP include the policy requirements for the issuance and management of NCP certificates.

 3) A Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) offering a quality of service less onerous than the NCP (requiring less demanding policy requirements) for use where a risk assessment does not justify the additional burden of meeting all requirements of the NCP (e.g. physical presence), for certificates used in support of any type of transaction (such as digital signatures, web authentication).

 4) An Extended Validation Certificate Policy (EVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for EVC. The requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of NCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from EVCG [4]. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Normalized Certificate Policy (NCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support EVC issuance and management as specified in EVCG [4].

 5) A Domain Validation Certificate Policy (DVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for DVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from the BRG [5] as applicable to domain validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support DVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].

 6) An Organizational Validation Certificate Policy (OVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for OVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from BRG [5] as applicable to organizational validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support OVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].

 7) An Individual Validation Certificate Policy (IVCP) for TLS/SSL certificates offering the level of assurance required by CAB Forum for IVC. The policy requirements for this CP are built on the policy requirements for the issuance and management of LCP certificates, enhanced to refer to requirements from the BRG [5] as applicable to individual validation certificates. It includes, except where explicitly indicated, all the Lightweight Certificate Policy (LCP) requirements, plus additional provisions suited to support IVC issuance and management as specified in BRG [5].

The above CPs can be used as they are without amendments but can also be used as a basis for creating more elaborate policies; clause 7 specifies a framework for other CPs which enhance or further constrain the above policies.

##### 4.2.3 Terms and conditions and PKI disclosure statement

A TSP is required to issue terms and conditions (see clause 6.9.4). This can be as part of the CPS or the CP if issued by the TSP. Alternatively, this can be a standalone document. The terms and conditions are specific to a TSP. The target audience of the terms and conditions can be the subscribers, the subjects and the relying parties.

The PKI disclosure statement is that part of the TSP's terms and conditions which relate to the operation of the PKI.

 NOTE: The presence of some elements is mandatory in the terms and conditions as requested in the present document, however the present document places no restriction on the form of terms and conditions; it can be a standalone document for a public audience, or it can be split over subscriber's agreement(s) and information to relying parties. The form and content of the terms and conditions can also depend on national regulations.


#### 4.3 Certification services

 NOTE 1: The present document does not mandate any sub division of the services of a TSP. Requirements are stated in subsequent clauses.

The certification services are broken down in the present document into the following component services for the purposes of classifying requirements:

- Registration service: verifies the identity and if applicable, any specific attributes of a subject. The results of     this service are passed to the certificate generation service.

 NOTE 2: This service includes proof of possession of, or control over, non-CA generated subject private keys.

- Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other attributes verified     by the registration service. This can include key generation.

- Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents, makes them available     to relying parties. This service also makes available the TSP's terms and conditions, and any published policy     and practice information, to subscribers and relying parties.

- Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to determine the     necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed through the revocation status service.

- Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying parties.

- Subject device provision service (optional): prepares, and provides or makes available secure cryptographic     devices, or other secure devices, to subjects.

 NOTE 3: Examples of this service are:

  a service which generates the subject's key pair and distributes the private key to the subject (this includes "soft" keys i.e. keys protected by software environment);

  a service which prepares the subject's signature-creation module and enabling codes and distributes the module to the registered subject.

This subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarification of policy requirements and places no restrictions on any subdivision of an implementation of the TSP's services.

Figure 1 illustrates the interrelationship between the services.

## 5 General provisions on Certification Practice

## Statement and Certificate Policies

#### 5.1 General requirements

The present document is structured broadly in line with IETF RFC 3647 [i.3] to assist TSPs in applying these requirements to their own documentation.

The present document includes the provision of services for registration, certificate generation, dissemination, revocation management and revocation status (see clause 4.3).

The requirements are indicated in terms of the security objectives followed by more specific requirements for controls to meet those objectives where considered necessary to provide the necessary confidence that those objective will be met.

 NOTE: The details of controls required to meet an objective is a balance between achieving the necessary confidence whilst minimizing the restrictions on the techniques that a TSP can employ in issuing certificates. In some cases reference is made to other more general standards which can be used as a source of more detailed control requirements. Due to these factors the specificity of the requirements given under a given topic can vary.

OVR-5.1-01: Void.

OVR-5.1-01A [NCP+, EVCP]: Unless otherwise specified, all requirements specified for [NCP] shall apply.

OVR-5.1-02: Void.

OVR-5.1-02A [DVCP, IVCP, OVCP]: Unless otherwise specified, all requirements specified for [LCP] shall apply.

OVR-5.1-03: The TSP's CP should specify the requirements for the use of certificate profiles.

#### 5.2 Certification Practice Statement requirements

OVR-5.2-01: The general requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 401 [8], clause 6.1 shall apply.

In addition the following particular requirements apply:

 NOTE 1: A TSP can document practices relating to specific CP requirements separate from the main CPS document.

OVR-5.2-02: The TSP's CPS should be structured in accordance with IETF RFC 3647 [i.3].

OVR-5.2-03: Void.

OVR-5.1-03A: The CP(s) identified by the TSP's documentation should specify the requirements on certificate profiles to be used.

OVR-5.2-04: The TSP's CPS shall include the signature algorithms and parameters employed.

OVR-5.2-05: The TSP shall publicly disclose its CPS through an online means that is available on a 24x7 basis.

 NOTE 2: The TSP is not obliged to disclose any aspects containing sensitive information.

OVR-5.2-06 [PTC]: The requirement preceding clause 2.1 in clause 2 of the BRG [5] shall apply.

OVR-5.2-07 [PTC]: Clause 2.2 of BRG [5] shall apply.

OVR-5.2-08 [EVCP]: Clause 8.3 of EVCG [4] shall apply.

OVR-5.2-09 [EVCP]: Clause 8.2.1 of EVCG [4] shall apply.

OVR-5.2-10: The TSP's CPS shall specify the practice regarding the use of CA keys for signing certificates, CRLs and OCSP.

OVR-5.2-11: If the TSP applies size limits on any subject naming attributes which are longer than the limits stated in IETF RFC 5280 [7] then the applied size limits should be stated in the TSP's published certification practice statement or terms and conditions.

#### 5.3 Certificate Policy name and identification

As described in IETF RFC 3647 [i.3], clause 3.3, certificates include a CP identifier which can be used by relying parties in determining the certificates suitability and trustworthiness for a particular application. The identifiers for the certificate policies specified in the present document are:

 a) NCP: Normalized Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) ncp (1)

 b) NCP+: Normalized Certificate Policy requiring a secure cryptographic device

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) ncpplus (2)

 c) LCP: Lightweight Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) lcp (3)

 d) EVCP: Extended Validation Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) evcp (4)

 e) DVCP: Domain Validation Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) dvcp (6)

 f) OVCP: Organizational Validation Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) ovcp (7)

 g) IVCP: Individual Validation Certificate Policy

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) other-certificate-policies(2042) policy-identifiers(1) ivcp (8)

OVR-5.3-01: If any changes are made to a CP as described in clause 4.2.2 which affects the applicability then the policy identifier should be changed.

#### 5.4 PKI participants

##### 5.4.1 Certification Authority

A CA is commonly understood to be a type of Trust Service Provider (TSP), as defined in the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.14], and also a form of certification service provider as defined in the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC [i.1], which issues public key certificates. However, in the present document the term is used more to reference the technical component of the TSP concerned with certificate issuance.

The authority trusted by the users of the certification services (i.e. subscribers as well as relying parties) to assign certificates is the TSP. The TSP has overall responsibility for the provision of the certification services identified in clause 4.3. The CA, as well as the TSP, can be identified in the certificate as the issuer and its private key is used to sign certificates.

OVR-5.4.1-01: The TSP may make use of other parties to provide parts of the certification service.

 NOTE: However, the TSP always maintains overall responsibility and ensures that the policy requirements identified in the present document are met (ETSI EN 319 401 [8], requirements REQ-6.3-05 and REQ-6.3-06).

 EXAMPLE: A TSP can sub-contract all the component services, including the certificate generation service (referred to as the CA in the present document). However, the key used to sign the certificates is identified as belonging to the CA, and the TSP maintains overall responsibility for meeting the requirements defined in the present document.

OVR-5.4.1-02: A TSP may include a hierarchy of CAs.

OVR-5.4.1-03 [CONDITIONAL]: Where a TSP includes a hierarchy of subordinate CAs up to a root CA, the TSP shall be responsible for ensuring the subordinate-CAs comply with the applicable policy requirements.

##### 5.4.2 Subscriber and subject

In the framework of the present policies, the subject can be:

- a natural person;

- a natural person identified in association with a legal person;


- a legal person (that can be an Organization or a unit or a department identified in association with an     Organization); or

- a device or system operated by or on behalf of a natural or legal person.

When a subscriber is the subject it will be held directly responsible if its obligations are not correctly fulfilled.

When the subscriber is acting on behalf of one or more distinct subjects to whom it is linked (e.g. the subscriber is a company requiring certificates for its employees to allow them to participate in electronic business on behalf of the company), responsibilities of the subscriber and of the subject are addressed in clause 6.3.4, REG-6.3.4-09 to REG-6.3.4-17.

The link between the subscriber and the subject is one of the following:

- To request a certificate for natural person the subscriber is:

- the natural person itself;

- a natural person mandated to represent the subject; or

 NOTE: The local legal dispositions can address the handover of responsibility to a third person.

- any entity with which the natural person is associated (such as the company employing the natural person     or a non-profit legal person the natural person is member of).

- To request a certificate for legal person the subscriber is:

- any entity as allowed under the relevant legal system to represent the legal person; or

- a legal representative of a legal person subscribing for its subsidiaries or units or departments.

- To request a certificate for a device or system operated by or on behalf of a natural or legal person the     subscriber is:

- the natural or legal person operating the device or system;

- any entity as allowed under the relevant legal system to represent the legal person; or

- a legal representative of a legal person subscribing for its subsidiaries or units or departments.

##### 5.4.3 Others

OVR-5.4.3-01: Other participants, not covered by the present document, may be identified by the TSP.

#### 5.5 Certificate usage

The policies NCP, NCP+ and LCP place no constraints on the user community and applicability of the certificate. The applicability of other certificates is as described below.

The specific purpose of EV Certificates is described in EVCG [4], clause 2.

The purpose of PTC is described in BRG [5], clause 1.4.1.

Certificates issued under EVCG [4] or BRG [5] are for publicly trusted certificates used to identify web servers accessed via the TLS or SSL protocol as per IETF RFC 5246 [i.11].

DIS-6.1-08: The information identified in DIS-6.1-04 above should be publicly and internationally available.

DIS-6.1-09 [CONDITIONAL]: If the TSP is issuing publicly-trusted certificates, the information identified in DIS-6.1-04 above shall be publicly and internationally available.

#### 6.2 Identification and authentication

##### 6.2.1 Naming

 NOTE: Requirements for naming in certificates are as specified in Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6] or IETF RFC 5280 [7] and the appropriate part of ETSI EN 319 412 [2], [9] and [10]. See clause 6.6.1 of the present document.

##### 6.2.2 Initial identity validation

REG-6.2.2-01: The TSP shall verify the identity of the subscriber and subject, and shall check that certificate requests are accurate, authorized and complete according to the collected evidence or attestation of identity.

 NOTE 1: When registering, a subject is identified as a person with specific attributes. The specific attributes can indicate, for example, an association within an organization and possibly, a role within that organization.

3
 NOTE 2: Identity validation is part of at least one of processes: certificate application, certificate issuance, subject device provisioning.

In particular:

- REG-6.2.2-02: Void.

- REG-6.2.2-02A: The TSP shall collect and validate either direct evidence or an attestation from an     appropriate and authorized source, of the identity (e.g. name) and if applicable, any specific attributes of     subjects to whom a certificate is issued.

 NOTE 3: Submitted evidence may be in the form of either paper or electronic documentation.

- REG-6.2.2-02B: Verification of the subject's identity shall be at time of registration by appropriate means.

 NOTE 4: The collection of evidence may include the copy of personal data, such as ID or passport. National regulations vary as to whether it is necessary or not to archive this information as such over long term. See REG-6.2.2-18.

- REG-6.2.2-03 [PTC]: The verification methods shall follow those specified in clause 3.2 of BRG [5].

- REG-6.2.2-04 [EVCP]: The verification methods shall follow those specified in clause 11 of the EVCG [4].

 When the subject is a natural person (i.e. physical person as opposed to legal person):

- REG-6.2.2-05 [NCP] [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a natural person (i.e. physical person as     opposed to legal person), evidence of the subject's identity (e.g. name) shall be checked against this     natural person either directly by physical presence of the person (the subject shall be witnessed in person     unless a duly mandated subscriber represents the subject), or shall have been checked indirectly using     means which provides equivalent assurance to physical presence.

 NOTE 5: An example of the required indirect evidence of identity is one or more registration documents electronically signed by a person trusted to have checked the persons' identity in line with the requirements of this clause. Some other examples can be found in annexes B and C of the EVCG [4].

- REG-6.2.2-06 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a natural person (i.e. physical person as opposed to     legal person), evidence shall be provided of:

 a) full name (including surname and given names consistent with the national identification practices);

 b) date and place of birth, reference to a nationally recognized identity document, or other attributes which can be used to, as far as possible, distinguish the person from others with the same name.

- REG-6.2.2-07 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a natural person (i.e. physical person as opposed to     legal person), the place of birth should be given in accordance to national or other applicable conventions     for registering births.

- REG-6.2.2-08 [NCP] [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a natural person who is identified in     association with a legal person (e.g. the subscriber), evidence of the identity, in particular the ones listed     in REG-6.2.2-09, shall be checked against a natural person either directly by physical presence of the     person (the subject shall be witnessed in person unless a duly mandated subscriber represents the     subject), or shall have been checked indirectly using means which provides equivalent assurance to     physical presence.

- REG-6.2.2-09 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a natural person who is identified in association with     a legal person (e.g. the subscriber), evidence shall be provided of:

 a) full name (including surname and given names, consistently with the national or other applicable identification practices) of the subject;

 b) date and place of birth, reference to a nationally recognized identity document, or other attributes of the subscriber which can be used to, as far as possible, distinguish the person from others with the same name;


 c) full name and legal status of the associated legal person or other organizational entity (e.g. the subscriber);

 d) any relevant existing registration information (e.g. company registration) of the associated legal person or other organizational entity identified in association with the legal person, consistent with the national or other applicable identification practices;

 e) affiliation of the natural person to the legal person consistent with national or other applicable identification practices;

 f) [CONDITIONAL]: when applicable, the association between the legal person and any organizational entity identified in association with this legal person that would appear in the organization attribute of the certificate, consistent with the national or other applicable identification practices; and

 g) approval by the legal person and the natural person that the subject attributes also identify such organization.

When the subject is a legal person, or other organizational entity identified in association with a legal person:

- REG-6.2.2-12 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a legal person, or other organizational entity     identified in association with a legal person, evidence shall be provided of:

 a) Full name of the organizational entity (private organization, government entity, business entity or non-commercial entity) consistent with the national or other applicable identification practices.

 b) [CONDITIONAL]: when applicable, the association between the legal person and the other organizational entity identified in association with this legal person that would appear in the organization attribute of the certificate, consistent with the national or other applicable identification practices.

When the subject is a device or system operated by or on behalf of a legal person, or other organizational entity identified in association with a legal person:

- REG-6.2.2-13 [NCP] except [EVCP] [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject is a device or system operated by     or on behalf of a legal person, or other organizational entity identified in association with a legal person,     evidence of the identity, in particular the ones listed in REG-6.2.2-15, shall be checked against a duly     mandated subscriber either directly, by physical presence of a person, or shall have been checked     indirectly using means which provides equivalent assurance to physical presence.

REG-6.3.8-01: Void.

REG-6.3.8-01A: The requirements of REG-6.3.6-01 to REG-6.3.6-09 and GEN-6.3.6-10 of clause 6.3.6 apply.

In particular:

- REG-6.3.8-02: If any certified names or attributes have changed, the registration information shall be verified,     recorded, agreed to by the subscriber in accordance with clause 6.2.2.

##### 6.3.9 Certificate revocation and suspension

REV-6.3.9-01: The TSP shall revoke certificates in a timely manner based on authorized and validated certificate revocation requests (see also REV-6.2.4-03).

REV-6.3.9-02: The TSP shall revoke any non expired certificate:

 a) that is no longer compliant with the CP under which it has been issued; or

 b) that the TSP is aware of changes which impact the validity of the certificate; or

 NOTE 1: It is not implied that the TSP needs to monitor information relating to the content.

 c) for which the used cryptography is no longer ensuring the binding between the subject and the public key.

REV-6.3.9-03: The subject, and where applicable the subscriber, of a revoked or suspended certificate, where possible, shall be informed of the change of status of the certificate.

 NOTE 2: It may not be possible to inform the subject for example if known to be deceased or otherwise not available to be contacted.

REV-6.3.9-04: Once a certificate is definitively revoked (i.e. not suspended) it shall not be reinstated.

Where Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) concerning end users' certificates including any variants (e.g. Delta CRLs) are used:

 NOTE 3: See clause 6.6.2 regarding CRL profile requirements.

- CSS-6.3.9-05 [CONDITIONAL]: If Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) concerning end users     certificates are used, including any variants, either the CRL or the variant shall be published at least     every 24 hours;

- CSS-6.3.9-06 [CONDITIONAL]: If Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) concerning end users certificates     including any variants (e.g. Delta CRLs) are used, every CRL shall state a time for next scheduled CRL issue,     unless it is the last CRL issued for those certificates in the scope of the CRL, in which case the nextUpdate     field in the CRL defined in IETF RFC 5280 [7], should be set to "99991231235959Z";

 NOTE 4: This value, defined in IETF RFC 5280 [7] for certificates that have no well-defined expiration date, is here extended for CRL.


- CSS-6.3.9-07 [CONDITIONAL]: If Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) concerning end users certificates     including any variants (e.g. Delta CRLs) are used, a new CRL may be published before the stated time of the     next CRL issue.

CSS-6.3.9-08 [CONDITIONAL]: If Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) concerning end users certificates including any variants (e.g. Delta CRLs) are used, the CRL shall be signed by the CA or an entity designated by the TSP.

CSS-6.3.9-09 [PTC]: The TSP shall operate and maintain its certificate status information.

CSS-6.3.9-10 [PTC]: Clause 4.10.2 of BRG [5] shall apply.

CSS-6.3.9-11 [EVCP]: TSP shall comply with EVCG [4], clause 13.

Where CARL is used:

- CSS-6.3.9-12 [CONDITIONAL]: If CARL is used, a new CARL shall be generated at least once a year with a     nextUpdate of at most 1 year after the issuing date;

- CSS-6.3.9-13 [CONDITIONAL]: If CARL is used, a new CARL shall be generated once a CA certificate has     been revoked.

CSS-6.3.9-14: In the case of any cross-certificates issued by the CA to other TSPs, the CARL should be issued at least every 31 days.

REV-6.3.9-15: A TSP need not to have a revocation management service to address requirements REV-6.2.4-01, REV-6.2.4-03A, REV-6.2.4-03B, REV-6.2.4-05 to REV-6.2.4-09, REV-6.3.9-01, REV-6.3.9-02 and SDP-6.5.1-2 for short-term certificates, as these requirements are not necessarily applicable to short-term certificates.

 NOTE 5: Requirements CSS-6.3.10-07 and CSS-6.3.10-08 still apply to TSP issuing short-term certificates. A TSP issuing short-term certificate can provide "good" OCSP responses or empty CRL for the concerned shortterm certificate for backward compatibility, however, checking such revocation status services will not provide additional information about the validity of the certificate.

 NOTE 6: Possibilities offered by REV-6.3.9-15 applies only to end user certificates; if a TSP fails to apply the applicable certificate policy, then its CA certificate can be revoked.

REV-6.3.9-16: A TSP issuing short-term certificates shall explicitly describe in the CPS which certificates cannot be revoked through a revocation management service and which certificates cannot be revoked even by the TSP on its own initiative.

 NOTE 7: The explanation that certain group of certificates cannot be revoked and their status never changes can be considered as an alternative to REV-6.2.4-01.

##### 6.3.10 Certificate status services

CSS-6.3.10-01: The TSP shall provide services for checking the status of the certificates.

In particular:

- CSS-6.3.10-02: Revocation status information shall be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Upon     system failure, service or other factors which are not under the control of the TSP, the TSP shall make best     endeavours to ensure that this information service is not unavailable for longer than a maximum period of time     as denoted in the CPS.

- CSS-6.3.10-03: The integrity and authenticity of the status information shall be protected.

- CSS-6.3.10-04: Revocation status information shall include information on the status of certificates at least     until the certificate expires.

 NOTE 1: ETSI EN 319 411-2 [i.5] specifies a standard way of providing certificate status information beyond expiry.


 Revocation status information methods:

- CSS-6.3.10-05: OCSP or CRL shall be supported.

- CSS-6.3.10-06: OCSP should be supported.

 NOTE 2: The support of OCSP is recommended. It is particularly important where CRLs are susceptible to be big in size, which can be the case for certificates whose validity at the time of use of the private key cannot be assured by the TSP.

- CSS-6.3.10-07 [PTC]: OCSP shall be supported.

 NOTE 3: See clause 6.6.3 for profile requirements of OCSP.

 NOTE 4: See clause 6.6.2 for profile requirements of CRL.

 When a TSP supports multiple methods (CRL and OCSP) to provide revocation status:

- CSS-6.3.10-08 [CONDITIONAL]: If a TSP supports multiple methods (CRL and on-line certificate     status service) to provide revocation status, any updates to revocation status shall be available for all     methods;

- CSS-6.3.10-09 [CONDITIONAL]: If a TSP supports multiple methods (CRL and on-line certificate     status service) to provide revocation status, the information provided by all services shall be consistent     over time taking into account different delays in updating the status information for all the methods.

 NOTE 5: Consistency over time allows for the difference in delays to be taken into account provided that the status of the certificate is ultimately the same and provided REV-6.2.4-03C can be respected. This can be done on the basis of the information provided under CSS-6.3. 10-9A.

 EXAMPLE: If OCSP can be updated immediately, OCSP and CRL may differ, until the new CRL has been generated.

- CSS-6.3.10-9A [CONDITIONAL]: If a TSP supports multiple methods (CRL and on-line certificate     status service) to provide revocation status and delays in updating the status information for all the     methods exist or are possible, the TSP shall document in its CPS the origin of such delays and how to     interpret the results in case of differences.

- CSS-6.3.10-10: The revocation status information shall be publicly and internationally available.

##### 6.3.11 End of subscription

No policy requirement.

##### 6.3.12 Key escrow and recovery

SDP-6.3.12-01: The security of any duplicated subject's private keys shall be at the same level as for the original subject's private keys.

SDP-6.3.12-02: The number of any duplicated subject's private keys shall not exceed the minimum needed to ensure continuity of the service.

SDP-6.3.12-03 [CONDITIONAL]: If the certificate key usage is of type A, B, or F as specified in clause 4.3.2 of ETSI EN 319 412-2 [9], then the CA shall not hold the subject's private signing keys in a way which provides a backup decryption capability (commonly called key escrow), and results in its use not being under the sole control (or if the subject is a legal person "control") of the signer or owner.

 NOTE: This does not preclude the TSP generating and managing the key on behalf of the user provided that the key is kept under the sole control (or if the subject is a legal person "control") of the user.

SDP-6.3.12-04 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject's private key is to be used for authentication, then the CA should not hold the subject's private signing keys in a way which provides a backup decryption capability (commonly called key escrow), and results in its use not being under the control of the signer or owner.

SDP-6.3.12-05 [CONDITIONAL]: If the subject's private key is to be used for decryption, then the CA may back it up.


SDP-6.3.12-06 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA requires a subject private key used for decryption to be escrowed by the CA or a designated entity, then this private key shall not have other key usages.

SDP-6.3.12-07 [CONDITIONAL]: If a copy of the subject's key is kept by the CA for escrow then the CA shall keep secret the private key and only make it available to appropriately authorized persons.

- GEN-6.5.1-06: CA key pair generation should be performed using an algorithm as specified in ETSI     TS 119 312 [i.10] for the CA's signing purposes.

 NOTE 1: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.

- GEN-6.5.1-07: The selected key length and algorithm for CA signing key should be one which is specified in     ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] for the CA's signing purposes.

 NOTE 2: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.

GEN-6.5.1-08: Before expiration of its CA certificate which is used for signing subject keys (for example as indicated by expiration of CA certificate), in case of continuing with the service, the CA shall generate a new certificate for signing subject key pairs, and shall apply all necessary actions to avoid disruption to the operations of any entity that may rely on the CA certificate.

GEN-6.5.1-09: Before expiration of its CA certificate which is used for signing subject keys (for example as indicated by expiration of CA certificate), in case of continuing with the service, the new CA certificate shall also be generated and distributed in accordance with the present document.

GEN-6.5.1-10: The operations described in GEN-6.5.1-08 and GEN-6.5.1-09 should be performed with a suitable interval between certificate expiry date and the last certificate signed to allow all parties that have relationships with the TSP (subjects, subscribers, relying parties, CAs higher in the CA hierarchy, etc.) to be aware of this key changeover and to implement the required operations to avoid inconveniences and malfunctions. This does not apply to a TSP which will cease its operations before its own certificate-signing certificate expiration date.

GEN-6.5.1-11: The TSP shall have a documented procedure for conducting CA key pair generation for certificate signing keys for all CAs, whether root CAs or subordinate CAs, including CAs that issue certificates to end users.

 a) roles participating in the ceremony (internal and external from the organization);

 b) functions to be performed by every role and in which phases;

 c) responsibilities during and after the ceremony; and

 d) requirements of evidence to be collected of the ceremony.

GEN-6.5.1-13: The TSP shall produce a report proving that the ceremony, as in GEN-6.5.1-11 above, was carried out in accordance with the stated procedure and that the integrity and confidentiality of the key pair was ensured.

GEN-6.5.1-14: This report shall be signed [CHOICE]:

- For root CA: by the trusted role responsible for the security of the TSP's key management ceremony     (e.g. security officer) and a trustworthy person independent of the TSP's management (e.g. Notary, auditor) as     witness that the report correctly records the key management ceremony as carried out.

- For subordinate CAs: by the trusted role responsible for the security of the TSP's key management ceremony     (e.g. security officer) as witness that the report correctly records the key management ceremony as carried out.

GEN-6.5.1-15 [PTC]: Clause 6.1.1.1 of the BRG [5] shall apply.

DIS-6.5.1-16: CA signature verification (public) keys shall be available to relying parties in a manner that assures the integrity of the CA public key and authenticates its origin.

 NOTE 3: For example, CA public keys can be distributed in self-signed certificates, along with a declaration that the key authenticates the CA, or issued by another CA. By itself a self-signed certificate cannot be known to come from the CA. Additional measures, such as checking the fingerprint of the certificate against information provided by a trusted source, is needed to give assurance of the correctness of this certificate.


When the CA generates the subject's keys:

- SDP-6.5.1-17 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, CA-generated subject keys shall be     generated using an algorithm recognized as being fit for the uses identified in the CP during the validity time     of the certificate.

 NOTE 4: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.

- SDP-6.5.1-19 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys , CA-generated subject keys shall be     generated and stored securely whilst held by the TSP.

- SDP-6.5.1-20 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the subject's private key shall be     delivered to the subject's device or to the TSP managing the subject's private key, in a manner such that the     secrecy and integrity of the key is not compromised.

- SDP-6.5.1-21 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys and if the TSP or any of its     designated RAs become aware that a subject's private key has been communicated to an unauthorized person     or an organization not affiliated with the subject, then the TSP shall revoke all certificates that include the     public key corresponding to the communicated private key.

- SDP-6.5.1-22 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the CA shall delete all copies of a     subject private key after delivery of the private key to the subject, except for conditions as described in     clause 6.3.12.

- SDP-6.5.1-23 [NCP+] [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the TSP shall secure the     issuance of a secure cryptographic device to the subject.

 In particular:

- SDP-6.5.1-24 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, secure cryptographic device     preparation shall be done securely.

 NOTE 4: This destruction does not necessarily affect all copies of the private key. Only the physical instance of the key stored in the secure cryptographic device under consideration will be destroyed.

##### 6.5.3 Other aspects of key pair management

OVR-6.5.3-01: The TSP shall use appropriately the CA private signing keys.

In particular:

- OVR-6.5.3-02: The TSP shall not use the CA private signing keys beyond the end of their life cycle.

- GEN-6.5.3-03: CA signing key(s) used for generating certificates as defined in clause 6.3.3, and/or issuing     revocation status information, shall not be used for any other purpose.

- GEN-6.5.3-04: The certificate signing keys shall only be used within physically secure premises.

- GEN-6.5.3-05: The use of the CA's private key shall be compatible with the hash algorithm, the signature     algorithm and signature key length used for generating certificates, in line with current practice as in     requirement GEN-6.5.1-07.

- GEN-6.5.3-06: All copies of the CA private signing keys shall be destroyed at the end of their life cycle.

- GEN-6.5.3-07 [CONDITIONAL]: If a self-signed certificate is issued by the CA, the attributes of the     certificate shall be compliant with the defined key usage as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6] and     aligned with GEN-6.5.3-05.

##### 6.5.4 Activation data

GEN-6.5.4-01: The installation and recovery of the CA's key pairs in a secure cryptographic device shall require simultaneous control of at least two trusted employees.

If the TSP issues a secure cryptographic device:

- SDP-6.5.4-02 [CONDITIONAL]: If the TSP issues a secure cryptographic device, secure cryptographic     device (e.g. smartcard) deactivation and reactivation shall be done securely.


- SDP-6.5.4-03 [CONDITIONAL]: If the TSP issues a secure cryptographic device, and where the personalized     secure cryptographic device (e.g. smartcard) has associated user activation data (e.g. PIN code), the activation     data shall be securely prepared and distributed separately from the secure cryptographic device.

 NOTE: Separation can be achieved by ensuring distribution of activation data and delivery of secure cryptographic device at different times, or via a different channel.

##### 6.5.5 Computer security controls

OVR-6.5.5-01: The requirements REQ-7.4-01, REQ-7.4-02, REQ-7.4-03 and REQ-7.4-10 in ETSI EN 319 401 [8] shall apply.

##### 6.5.8 Timestamping

 NOTE: Not in the scope of the present document. See ETSI EN 319 421 [i.15] for policy requirements for TSPs issuing time-stamps.

#### 6.6 Certificate, CRL and OCSP profiles

##### 6.6.1 Certificate profile

GEN-6.6.1-01: The certificates shall meet the requirements specified in Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6] or IETF RFC 5280 [7].

GEN-6.6.1-02: The certificate shall be issued according to the relevant certificate profile [CHOICE]:

- [LCP, NCP and NCP+] for issuance of certificates to natural persons (excluding for web site certificates):     ETSI EN 319 412-2 [9].

- [LCP, NCP and NCP+] for issuance of certificates to legal persons (excluding for web site certificates):     ETSI EN 319 412-3 [10].

- [PTC] for issuance of certificates for web sites or devices:     ETSI EN 319 412-4 [2].

GEN-6.6.1-03: A TSP issuing short-term certificate should use the validity assured extension ext-etsi-valassuredST-certs defined in ETSI TS 119 412-1 [13] within the short-term certificates which cannot be revoked.

GEN-6.6.1-04: The TSP issuing short-term certificates should not use the validity assured extension ext-etsivalassured-ST-certs defined in ETSI TS 119 412-1 [13] in short-term certificates which can be revoked.

GEN-6.6.1-05: The TSP shall not use the validity assured extension ext-etsi-valassured-ST-certs defined in ETSI TS 119 412-1 [13] in certificates which are not short-term certificates.

##### 6.6.2 CRL profile

OVR-6.6.2-01: The CRL shall be as defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8/Recommendation ITU-T X.509 [6] or IETF RFC 5280 [7].

##### 6.6.3 OCSP profile

OVR-6.6.3-01: The OCSP shall be as defined in IETF RFC 6960 [11].

 NOTE 1: A TSP can decide to use the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in the certificate profile of a delegated OCSP responder as described in clause 4.2.2.2.1 (Revocation Checking of an Authorized Responder) of IETF RFC 6960 [11]. In that case, no revocation status information is required for determining the status of the corresponding responder certificate which may be considered as useful for various reasons. However, a TSP who decides to do so takes the following additional risks into account in its risk assessment:

  As stipulated in IETF RFC 6960 [11], an OCSP responder key compromise is, in this case, as severe as a compromise of the corresponding issuing CA key. To this reason, the TSP carefully considers OCSP responder key management and particularly considers reducing responder certificate lifetime to a reasonable duration.


  Third party applications like SVAs that rely on the TSP's certificate status information services may not be able to handle this non-critical extension. Consequently they can end up with operational issues when no fall back scenario like complementary provisioning of a CRL is implemented for revealing the responder status, or can end up in invalidating the signature.

 This can be documented within the CPS/CP.

OVR-6.6.3-02: If the OCSP responder receives a request for status of a certificate that has not been issued then the responder shall not respond with a "good" status as per clause 2.2 of IETF RFC 6960 [11].

 NOTE 2: When both OCSP and CRL are provided, the TSP needs to configure OCSP answers for non-issued certificates in a way which is appropriate to meet the consistency requirement CSS-6.3.10-09. In particular, if the responder sends a "revoked" response, the non-issued reason needs to be identifiable (knowing that non-issued certificates do not appear in a CRL).

OVR-6.6.3-03: The CA should monitor such requests concerning non-issued certificates on the responder as part of its security response procedures to check if this is an indication of an attack.

## Annex A (informative):

## Model PKI disclosure statement

## A.1 Introduction

The proposed model PKI disclosure statement is for use as a supplemental instrument of disclosure and notice by a TSP. A PKI disclosure statement may assist a TSP to respond to regulatory requirements and concerns, particularly those related to consumer deployment. Further, the aim of the model PKI disclosure statement is to foster industry "self-regulation" and build consensus on those elements of a CP and/or CPS that require emphasis and disclosure.

Although CP and CPS documents are essential for describing and governing certificate policies and practices, many PKI users, especially consumers, find these documents difficult to understand. Consequently, there is a need for a supplemental and simplified instrument that can assist PKI users in making informed trust decisions. Consequently, a PKI disclosure statement is not intended to replace a CP or CPS.

This annex provides an example of the structure for a PKI disclosure statement.

## A.2 The PDS structure

The PDS contains a clause for each defined statement type. Each clause of a PDS contains a descriptive statement, which may include hyperlinks to the relevant CP/CPS clauses.

 Statement types Statement descriptions Specific Requirements ofcertificate policy TSP contact info The name, location and relevant contact information for the CA/PKI (name of responsible person, address, website, info mail, FAQ, etc.), including clear information on how to contact the TSP to request a revocation.

## A.3 The PDS format

The PDS should be available under PDF/A format as specified in ISO 19005 parts 1 to 3 [i.4].


## Annex B (informative):

## Conformity assessment checklist

A checklist for the policy requirements specified in the present document as well as the generic requirements which are independent of the TSP (as expressed in ETSI EN 319 401 [8]) is contained in ETSI TR 119 411-4 [i.20].

The checklist provides all requirements identifiers in such a way that it can be used by the TSP itself to prepare for an assessment of its practices against the present document (i.e. serve as a basis for a self-declaration) and/or by the assessor when conducting the assessment, for the sake of facility for both the assessor and the TSP to be assessed.

## Change history

 Date Version Information about changes February 2016 1.1.1 Publication

 June 2017 1.2.0

 Below is a non-exhaustive list of the changes carried out since V1.1.1.

- All requirements numbered as per clause 3.4.

- Requirement numbering; all requirements are identified by a unique number.

- New versions of the CA/B Forum documents are considered (EVCG V.1.6.1 for     ECVP], and BRG v1.4.2 for PTC).

- Several editorial changes and clarifications.

- Adaptation of definitions for CRL and CARL.

- New definitions for revocation and domain name.

- Clarification on the concepts CA and TSP (and consistent application thorough     the document).

- Addition of a CP, the IVCP, for certificates that includes validated individual     identity information for the subject.

- Clarification on subject device provisioning service to cover the fact that it     includes "soft keys" management.

- Clarification that Identity validation is part of at least one of processes:     certificate application, certificate issuance, subject device provisioning.

- Clarification of requirement mentioning "issuing certificates considering the     expiry date of the CA certificate" with "issuing certificates whose lifetime     exceeds that of the CA's signing certificate" and further specifications.

- Clarification of requirement on DN re-assignment.

- Clarification of requirements with regard to the subscriber agreement that does     not need to be "signed" anymore but "ratified".

- Clarification of requirements with regard to the "confirmation that the     information in the certificate is correct" by "the information to be held in the     certificate is correct" and allowing to do this by reference (to the CP e.g.).

- Alleviation of obligation to notify the subject in case of revocation (e.g. this may     be impossible if the subject is dead).

- Definition of a value for the CRL nextUpdate field when the CRL is the last one     issued for a certain scope.

- Mandatory support of CRL or OCSP. OCPS remains recommended, and is     mandatory for certain CPs, but not strictly mandatory for all CPs.

- Trusted Role identified in CEN TS 419 261 should be supported (not     mandatory anymore).

- Extension of some requirements on the CA (certificate signing) keys, to keys     used by revocation and registration services.

- Additional requirements on OCSP profile; if the OCSP responder receives a     request for status of a certificate that has not been issued, then the responder     is mandated not to respond with a "good" status and the TSP should monitor     such requests.

- Requirement to have subject legal person to ratify a second part of the     subscriber agreement.

- Additional requirement for trustworthy device (HSM) to be operated in its     evaluated configuration as described in the CC guidance documentation or an     equivalent configuration.

- Clarification of the minimal elements to be part of the general terms and     conditions (clause 6.4.9).

- Deletion of text "If the TSPs Trust Anchor is signed by a Root CA outside the     scope of the TSP policies then the Root CA requirements apply to the TSP's     Trust Anchor." because the definition of Root-CA is sufficiently clear to this     regard.

- Removal of references to physical presence of the subscriber in clause 6.3.6     (renewal).


 Date Version Information about changes

January 2018 1.2.1

 Following ENAP public enquiry, the following changes were made. On https://docbox.etsi.org/esi/Open/Compared_deliverables, one will be able to see what changes have taken place between the previous published version (v1.1.1) and this version.

REV-6.2.4-05: replaced "in advance" by "at a future date" and correction of wrong reference. Harmonisation of the use of "electronic signature", "electronic seal" and "digital signature" and reference to the certificate key usage is of type A, B, or F as specified in clause 4.3.2 of ETSI EN 319 412-2 to generalize electronic signatures or seal to usage beyond the eIDAS Regulation (mainly impacting OVR-6.3.5-01 and SDP-6.3.12-03). Reworking of OVR-6.3.5-01 as the requirement was requiring the subscriber's obligations to literally include items a) to j) expressed below, i.e. a copy paste of the text of the standard and adaptation of OVR-6.3.5-02 accordingly. Addition of REV-6.3.9-02 to require revocation under certain circumstances. Annex B modified to point to ETSI TR 119 411-4 will contain the checklist. April 2018 1.2.2 Publication
